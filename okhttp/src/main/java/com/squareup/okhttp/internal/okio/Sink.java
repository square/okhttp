/**
 * Receives a stream of bytes. Use this interface to write data wherever it's
 * needed: to the network, storage, or a buffer in memory. Sinks may be layered
 * to transform received data, such as to compress, encrypt, throttle, or add
 * protocol framing.
 *
 * <p>Most application code shouldn't operate on a sink directly, but rather
 * {@link BufferedSink} which is both more efficient and more convenient. Use
 * {@link Okio#buffer(Sink)} to wrap any sink with a buffer.
 *
 * <p>Sinks are easy to test: just use an {@link OkBuffer} in your tests, and
 * read from it to confirm it received the data that was expected.
 *
 * <h3>Comparison with OutputStream</h3>
 * This interface is functionally equivalent to {@link java.io.OutputStream}.
 *
 * <p>{@code OutputStream} requires multiple layers when emitted data is
 * heterogeneous: a {@code DataOutputStream} for primitive values, a {@code
 * BufferedOutputStream} for buffering, and {@code OutputStreamWriter} for
 * charset encoding. This class uses {@code BufferedSink} for all of the above.
 *
 * <p>Sink is also easier to layer: there is no {@link
 * java.io.OutputStream#write(int) single-byte write} method that is awkward to
 * implement efficiently.
 *
 * <h3>Interop with OutputStream</h3>
 * Use {@link Okio#sink} to adapt an {@code OutputStream} to a sink. Use {@link
 * BufferedSink#outputStream} to adapt a sink to an {@code OutputStream}.
