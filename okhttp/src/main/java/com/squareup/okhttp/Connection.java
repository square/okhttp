/**
 * The sockets and streams of an HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTPS+SPDY connection. May be
 * used for multiple HTTP request/response exchanges. Connections may be direct
 * to the origin server or via a proxy.
 *
 * <p>Typically instances of this class are created, connected and exercised
 * automatically by the HTTP client. Applications may use this class to monitor
 * HTTP connections as members of a {@linkplain ConnectionPool connection pool}.
 *
 * <p>Do not confuse this class with the misnamed {@code HttpURLConnection},
 * which isn't so much a connection as a single request/response exchange.
 *
 * <h3>Modern TLS</h3>
 * There are tradeoffs when selecting which options to include when negotiating
 * a secure connection to a remote host. Newer TLS options are quite useful:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Server Name Indication (SNI) enables one IP address to negotiate secure
 *       connections for multiple domain names.
 *   <li>Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) enables the HTTPS port
 *       (443) to be used for different HTTP and SPDY protocols.
 * </ul>
 * Unfortunately, older HTTPS servers refuse to connect when such options are
 * presented. Rather than avoiding these options entirely, this class allows a
 * connection to be attempted with modern options and then retried without them
 * should the attempt fail.
