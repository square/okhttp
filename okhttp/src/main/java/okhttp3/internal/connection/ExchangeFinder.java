/**
 * Attempts to find the connections for a sequence of exchanges. This uses the following strategies:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If the current call already has a connection that can satisfy the request it is used.
 *       Using the same connection for an initial exchange and its follow-ups may improve locality.
 *
 *   <li>If there is a connection in the pool that can satisfy the request it is used. Note that
 *       it is possible for shared exchanges to make requests to different host names! See {@link
 *       RealConnection#isEligible} for details.
 *
 *   <li>If there's no existing connection, make a list of routes (which may require blocking DNS
 *       lookups) and attempt a new connection them. When failures occur, retries iterate the list
 *       of available routes.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>If the pool gains an eligible connection while DNS, TCP, or TLS work is in flight, this finder
 * will prefer pooled connections. Only pooled HTTP/2 connections are used for such de-duplication.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to cancel the finding process.
