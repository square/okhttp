/**
 * Attempts to find the connections for a sequence of exchanges. This uses the following strategies:
 *
 *  1. If the current call already has a connection that can satisfy the request it is used. Using
 *     the same connection for an initial exchange and its follow-ups may improve locality.
 *
 *  2. If there is a connection in the pool that can satisfy the request it is used. Note that it is
 *     possible for shared exchanges to make requests to different host names! See
 *     [RealConnection.isEligible] for details.
 *
 *  3. If there's no existing connection, make a list of routes (which may require blocking DNS
 *     lookups) and attempt a new connection them. When failures occur, retries iterate the list of
 *     available routes.
 *
 * If the pool gains an eligible connection while DNS, TCP, or TLS work is in flight, this finder
 * will prefer pooled connections. Only pooled HTTP/2 connections are used for such de-duplication.
 *
 * It is possible to cancel the finding process.
