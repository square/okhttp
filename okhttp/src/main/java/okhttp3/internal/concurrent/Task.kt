/**
 * A unit of work that can be executed one or more times.
 *
 * Cancellation
 * ------------
 *
 * Tasks control their cancellation. If the hosting queue is canceled, the [Task.tryCancel] function
 * returns true if the task should skip the next-scheduled execution. Note that canceling a task is
 * not permanent; it is okay to schedule a task after it has been canceled.
 *
 * Recurrence
 * ----------
 *
 * Tasks control their recurrence schedule. The [runOnce] function returns -1L to signify that the
 * task should not be executed again. Otherwise it returns a delay until the next execution.
 *
 * A task has at most one next execution. If the same task instance is scheduled multiple times, the
 * earliest one wins. This applies to both executions scheduled with [TaskRunner.Queue.schedule] and
 * those implied by the returned execution delay.
 *
 * Task Queues
 * -----------
 *
 * Tasks are bound to the [TaskQueue] they are scheduled in. Each queue is sequential and the tasks
 * within it never execute concurrently. It is an error to use a task in multiple queues.
