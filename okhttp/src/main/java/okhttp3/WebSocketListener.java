 * socket was successfully opened or if there was an error connecting to the server or parsing its
 * response.</li>
 * <li>After {@link #onOpen} is called, {@link #onFailure} can be called at any time. No more
 * callbacks will follow a call to {@link #onFailure}.</li>
 * <li>After {@link #onOpen} is called, {@link #onMessage} and {@link #onPong} will be called for
 * each message and pong frame, respectively. Note: {@link #onPong} may be called while {@link
 * #onMessage} is reading the message because pong frames may interleave in the message body.</li>
 * <li>After {@link #onOpen} is called, {@link #onClose} may be called once. No calls to {@link
 * #onMessage} or {@link #onPong} will follow a call to {@link #onClose}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #onFailure} will be called if any of the other callbacks throws an exception.</li>
