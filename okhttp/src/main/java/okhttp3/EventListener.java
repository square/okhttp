/**
 * EventListener for analytic events for an OkHttpClient instance.
 *
 * <p>All start/connect/acquire events will eventually receive a matching end/release event,
 * either successful (non-null parameters), or failed (non-null throwable).  The first common
 * parameters of each event pair are used to link the event in case of concurrent or repeated
 * events e.g. dnsStart(call, domainName) -> dnsEnd(call, domainName, inetAddressList, throwable).
 *
 * <p>Nesting is as follows
 * <ul>
 * <li>call -> (dns -> connect -> secure connect)* -> request events</li>
 * <li>call -> (connection acquire/release)*</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Request events are ordered: requestHeaders -> requestBody -> responseHeaders -> responseBody
 *
 * <p>Since connections may be reused, the dns and connect events may not be present for a call,
 * or may be repeated in case of failure retries, even concurrently in case of happy eyeballs type
 * scenarios. A redirect cross domain, or to use https may cause additional connection and request
 * events.
 *
 * <p>All events must fast, without external locking, cannot throw exceptions,
 * attempt to mutate the event parameters, or be reentrant back into the client.
 * Any IO - writing to files or network should be done asynchronously.
