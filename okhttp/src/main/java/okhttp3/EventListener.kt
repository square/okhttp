/**
 * Listener for metrics events. Extend this class to monitor the quantity, size, and duration of
 * your application's HTTP calls.
 *
 * All start/connect/acquire events will eventually receive a matching end/release event, either
 * successful (non-null parameters), or failed (non-null throwable).  The first common parameters of
 * each event pair are used to link the event in case of concurrent or repeated events e.g.
 * dnsStart(call, domainName) -&gt; dnsEnd(call, domainName, inetAddressList).
 *
 * Nesting is as follows
 *
 *  * call -&gt; (dns -&gt; connect -&gt; secure connect)* -&gt; request events
 *  * call -&gt; (connection acquire/release)*
 *
 * Request events are ordered:
 *
 * requestHeaders -&gt; requestBody -&gt; responseHeaders -&gt; responseBody
 *
 * Since connections may be reused, the dns and connect events may not be present for a call, or may
 * be repeated in case of failure retries, even concurrently in case of happy eyeballs type
 * scenarios. A redirect cross domain, or to use https may cause additional connection and request
 * events.
 *
 * All event methods must execute fast, without external locking, cannot throw exceptions, attempt
 * to mutate the event parameters, or be re-entrant back into the client. Any IO - writing to files
 * or network should be done asynchronously.
