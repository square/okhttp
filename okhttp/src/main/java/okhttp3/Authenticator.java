/**
 * Performs either <strong>preemptive</strong> authentication before connecting to a proxy server,
 * or <strong>reactive</strong> authentication after receiving a challenge from either an origin web
 * server or proxy server.
 *
 * <h3>Preemptive Authentication</h3>
 *
 * <p>To make HTTPS calls using an HTTP proxy server OkHttp must first negotiate a connection with
 * the proxy. This proxy connection is called a "TLS Tunnel" and is specified by <a
 * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817">RFC 2817</a>. The HTTP CONNECT request that creates
 * this tunnel connection is special: it does not participate in any {@linkplain Interceptor
 * interceptors} or {@linkplain EventListener event listeners}. It doesn't include the motivating
 * request's HTTP headers or even its full URL; only the target server's hostname is sent to the
 * proxy.
 *
 * <p>Prior to sending any CONNECT request OkHttp always calls the proxy authenticator so that it
 * may prepare preemptive authentication. OkHttp will call {@link #authenticate} with a fake {@code
 * HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required} response that has a {@code Proxy-Authenticate:
 * OkHttp-Preemptive} challenge. The proxy authenticator may return either either an authenticated
 * request, or null to connect without authentication.
 * <pre>   {@code
 *    for (Challenge challenge : response.challenges()) {
 *      // If this is preemptive auth, use a preemptive credential.
 *      if (challenge.scheme().equalsIgnoreCase("OkHttp-Preemptive")) {
 *        return response.request().newBuilder()
 *            .header("Proxy-Authorization", "secret")
 *            .build();
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 *    return null; // Didn't find a preemptive auth scheme.
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Reactive Authentication</h3>
 *
 * <p>Implementations authenticate by returning a follow-up request that includes an authorization
 * header, or they may decline the challenge by returning null. In this case the unauthenticated
 * response will be returned to the caller that triggered it.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should check if the initial request already included an attempt to
 * authenticate. If so it is likely that further attempts will not be useful and the authenticator
 * should give up.
 *
 * <p>When reactive authentication is requested by an origin web server, the response code is 401
 * and the implementation should respond with a new request that sets the "Authorization" header.
 * <pre>   {@code
 *
 *    if (response.request().header("Authorization") != null) {
 *      return null; // Give up, we've already failed to authenticate.
 *    }
 *
 *    String credential = Credentials.basic(...)
 *    return response.request().newBuilder()
 *        .header("Authorization", credential)
 *        .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>When reactive authentication is requested by a proxy server, the response code is 407 and the
 * implementation should respond with a new request that sets the "Proxy-Authorization" header.
 * <pre>   {@code
 *
 *    if (response.request().header("Proxy-Authorization") != null) {
 *      return null; // Give up, we've already failed to authenticate.
 *    }
 *
 *    String credential = Credentials.basic(...)
 *    return response.request().newBuilder()
 *        .header("Proxy-Authorization", credential)
 *        .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The proxy authenticator may implement preemptive authentication, reactive authentication, or
 * both.
 *
 * <p>Applications may configure OkHttp with an authenticator for origin servers, or proxy servers,
 * or both.
