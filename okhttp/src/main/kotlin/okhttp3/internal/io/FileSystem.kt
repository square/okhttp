/**
 * Access to read and write files on a hierarchical data store. Most callers should use the
 * [SYSTEM] implementation, which uses the host machine's local file system. Alternate
 * implementations may be used to inject faults (for testing) or to transform stored data (to add
 * encryption, for example).
 *
 * All operations on a file system are racy. For example, guarding a call to [source] with
 * [exists] does not guarantee that [FileNotFoundException] will not be thrown. The
 * file may be moved between the two calls!
 *
 * This interface is less ambitious than [java.nio.file.FileSystem] introduced in Java 7.
 * It lacks important features like file watching, metadata, permissions, and disk space
 * information. In exchange for these limitations, this interface is easier to implement and works
 * on all versions of Java and Android.
