/**
 * An in-memory DNS query cache to save time and bandwidth.
 *
 * Cache Lifetime and Expiration
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * DNS resource records include a time to live (TTL) lifetime for returned records. This class
 * honors that setting, but with bounds:
 *
 *  * Records with a time to live lower than [minimumTimeToLive] will be used for
 *    [minimumTimeToLive]. The default value of this is 10 seconds.
 *
 *  * Records with a time to live greater than [maximumTimeToLive] will be used for
 *    [maximumTimeToLive]. The default value of this is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
 *
 * If there is a failure fetching DNS records, or if no DNS records are returned, this failure is
 * also cached for [failureTimeToLive]. The default value of this is 10 seconds.
 *
 * Revalidation
 * ------------
 *
 * If a cached record will expire soon, the cached record is returned immediately, but this cache
 * will also asynchronously update the value for the benefit of future requests.
 *
 * This way if a steady stream of requests are made for the same hostname, none of the requests will
 * have to wait for DNS.
 *
 * The default value of [revalidateBeforeExpire] is 2 seconds.
 *
 * Request Merging
 * ---------------
 *
 * If the cache receives multiple equivalent queries, it combines them into a single query on the
 * underlying transport.
 *
 * Memory Usage
 * ------------
 *
 * This cache retains [maxSize] entries. It prefers to evict expired entries, and when that is
 * insufficient, it evicts the least recently requested entries.
 *
 * The default [maxSize] is 1,000 entries. Most hostnames will require 3 entries for DNS record
 * types `A` (IPv4), `AAAA` (IPv6), and `HTTPS` (service metadata).
 *
 * Between evictions, the cache may grow to double this configured limit. Each entry consumes about
 * 400 bytes of memory. In total, the default cache will use about 800 KiB of memory when it is
 * full.
