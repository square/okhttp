/**
 * An application-layer DNS call that performs multiple transport-layer DNS queries in parallel.
 * This delegates to an arbitrary transport  like UDP or DNS over HTTPS.
 *
 * Concurrency
 * -----------
 *
 * A few things conspire to make concurrency tricky:
 *
 *  * Each DNS record type is queried in parallel; [Transport.Callback.onResponse] and
 *    [Transport.Callback.onFailure] may be called concurrently.
 *  * Calls to [okhttp3.Dns.Callback] must be serialized.
 *  * We don't want to use locks to guard access to [okhttp3.Dns.Callback] functions.
 *
 * Each time we receive data for the callback (in the form of records or an exception), we either
 * immediately call the callback with that data (on a dispatcher thread), or queue it for the thread
 * that's busy calling the callback.
 *
 * After calling a callback, the caller must check to see if there's more data queued to deliver,
 * and deliver that also.
 *
 * The potentially surprising outcome of this strategy is the thread that performed the `TYPE_AAAA`
 * DNS request may also deliver the `TYPE_A` records to the callback, or vice versa.
 *
 * If a thread is intending to call the callback, it sets [State.Running.lockHeld] to true while
 * that call is executing.
