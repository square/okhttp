Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to OkHttp you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify`. Checkstyle failures
during compilation indicate errors in your style and can be viewed in the
`checkstyle-result.xml` file.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][1].
