OkHttp Coroutines
=================

Support for Kotlin clients using coroutines.

```kotlin
val call = client.newCall(request)

call.executeAsync().use {
  withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    println(response.body?.string())
  }
}
```

This is implemented using `suspendCancellableCoroutine`
but uses the standard Dispatcher in OkHttp. This means
that by default Kotlin's Dispatchers are not used.

Cancellation if implemented sensibly in both directions.
Cancelling a coroutine scope, will cancel the call.
Cancelling a call, will throw a CancellationException
but not cancel the scope if caught.
