This is simple in theory but it gets tricky in practice. Requests Each HTTP request contains a URL, a method (like GET or POST ), and a list of headers. Requests may also contain a body: a data stream of a specific content type. Responses The response answers the request with a code (like 200 for success or 404 for not found), headers, and its own optional body. Rewriting Requests When you provide OkHttp with an HTTP request, you\u2019re describing the request at a high-level: \u201cfetch me this URL with these headers.\u201d For correctness and efficiency, OkHttp rewrites your request before transmitting it. OkHttp may add headers that are absent from the original request, including Content-Length , Transfer-Encoding , User-Agent , Host , Connection , and Content-Type . It will add an Accept-Encoding header for transparent response compression unless the header is already present. If you\u2019ve got cookies, OkHttp will add a Cookie header with them. Some requests will have a cached response. When this cached response isn\u2019t fresh, OkHttp can do a conditional GET to download an updated response if it\u2019s newer than what\u2019s cached. This requires headers like If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match to be added. Rewriting Responses If transparent compression was used, OkHttp will drop the corresponding response headers Content-Encoding and Content-Length because they don\u2019t apply to the decompressed response body. If a conditional GET was successful, responses from the network and cache are merged as directed by the spec. Follow-up Requests When your requested URL has moved, the webserver will return a response code like 302 to indicate the document\u2019s new URL. OkHttp will follow the redirect to retrieve a final response. If the response issues an authorization challenge, OkHttp will ask the Authenticator (if one is configured) to satisfy the challenge. If the authenticator supplies a credential, the request is retried with that credential included. Retrying Requests Sometimes connections fail: either a pooled connection was stale and disconnected, or the webserver itself couldn\u2019t be reached. OkHttp will retry the request with a different route if one is available. Calls With rewrites, redirects, follow-ups and retries, your simple request may yield many requests and responses. OkHttp uses Call to model the task of satisfying your request through however many intermediate requests and responses are necessary. Typically this isn\u2019t many! But it\u2019s comforting to know that your code will continue to work if your URLs are redirected or if you failover to an alternate IP address. Calls are executed in one of two ways: Synchronous: your thread blocks until the response is readable. Asynchronous: you enqueue the request on any thread, and get called back on another thread when the response is readable. Calls can be canceled from any thread. This will fail the call if it hasn\u2019t yet completed! Code that is writing the request body or reading the response body will suffer an IOException when its call is canceled. Dispatch For synchronous calls, you bring your own thread and are responsible for managing how many simultaneous requests you make. Too many simultaneous connections wastes resources; too few harms latency. For asynchronous calls, Dispatcher implements policy for maximum simultaneous requests. You can set maximums per-webserver (default is 5), and overall (default is 64).","title":"Calls"},{"location":"calls/#calls","text":"The HTTP client\u2019s job is to accept your request and produce its response.

We were using a feature of SimpleDateFormat that wasn t available in those versions! Version 4.8.0 2020-07-11 New: Change HeldCertificate.Builder to use its own ASN.1 certificate encoder. This is part of our effort to remove the okhttp-tls module s dependency on Bouncy Castle. We think Bouncy Castle is great! But it s a large dependency (6.5 MiB) and its security provider feature impacts VM-wide behavior. New: Reduce contention for applications that make a very high number of concurrent requests. Previously OkHttp used its connection pool as a lock when making changes to connections and calls. With this change each connection is locked independently. Upgrade: Okio 2.7.0 . implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.7.0 ) Fix: Avoid log messages like Didn t find class org.conscrypt.ConscryptHostnameVerifier when detecting the TLS capabilities of the host platform. Fix: Don t crash in HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain() when the hostname is malformed. Fix: Don t attempt Brotli decompression if the response body is empty. Version 4.7.2 2020-05-20 Fix: Don t crash inspecting whether the host platform is JVM or Android. With 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 we had a crash IllegalArgumentException: Not a Conscrypt trust manager because we depended on initialization order of companion objects. Version 4.7.1 2020-05-18 Fix: Pass the right arguments in the trust manager created for addInsecureHost() . Without the fix insecure hosts crash with an IllegalArgumentException on Android. Version 4.7.0 2020-05-17 New: HandshakeCertificates.Builder.addInsecureHost() makes it easy to turn off security in private development environments that only carry test data. Prefer this over creating an all-trusting TrustManager because only hosts on the allowlist are insecure. From our DevServer sample : val clientCertificates = HandshakeCertificates . Builder () . addPlatformTrustedCertificates () . addInsecureHost ( localhost ) . build () val client = OkHttpClient . Builder () . sslSocketFactory ( clientCertificates . sslSocketFactory (), clientCertificates . trustManager ) . build () New: Add cacheHit , cacheMiss , and cacheConditionalHit() events to EventListener . Use these in logs, metrics, and even test cases to confirm your cache headers are configured as expected. New: Constant string okhttp3.VERSION . This is a string like 4.5.0-RC1 , 4.5.0 , or 4.6.0-SNAPSHOT indicating the version of OkHttp in the current runtime. Use this to include the OkHttp version in custom User-Agent headers. Fix: Don t crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it s running in a JVM or in Android. The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp! Fix: Include the header Accept: text/event-stream for SSE calls. This header is not added if the request already contains an Accept header. Fix: Don t crash with a NullPointerException if a server sends a close while we re sending a ping. OkHttp had a race condition bug. Version 4.6.0 2020-04-28 Fix: Follow HTTP 307 and 308 redirects on methods other than GET and POST. We re reluctant to change OkHttp s behavior in handling common HTTP status codes, but this fix is overdue! The new behavior is now consistent with RFC 7231 , which is newer than OkHttp itself. If you want this update with the old behavior use this interceptor . Fix: Don t crash decompressing web sockets messages. We had a bug where we assumed deflated bytes in would always yield deflated bytes out and this isn t always the case! Fix: Reliably update and invalidate the disk cache on windows. As originally designed our internal DiskLruCache assumes an inode-like file system, where it s fine to delete files that are currently being read or written. On Windows the file system forbids this so we must be more careful when deleting and renaming files. Fix: Don t crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and above. See Jetty s overview of the API change and its consequences. New: MultipartReader is a streaming decoder for MIME multipart (RFC 2045) messages. It complements MultipartBody which is our streaming encoder. val response : Response = call . execute () val multipartReader = MultipartReader ( response . body !! ) multipartReader . use { while ( true ) { val part = multipartReader . nextPart () ?: break process ( part . headers , part . body ) } } New: MediaType.parameter() gets a parameter like boundary from a media type like multipart/mixed; boundary=\"abc\" . New: Authenticator.JAVA_NET_AUTHENTICATOR forwards authentication requests to java.net.Authenticator . This obsoletes JavaNetAuthenticator in the okhttp-urlconnection module. New: CertificatePinner now offers an API for inspecting the configured pins. Upgrade: Okio 2.6.0 . implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.6.0 ) Upgrade: publicsuffix.org data . This powers HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain() . It s also how OkHttp knows which domains can share cookies with one another. Upgrade: Bouncy Castle 1.65 . This dependency is required by the okhttp-tls module. Upgrade: Kotlin 1.3.71 . Version 4.5.0 2020-04-06 This release fixes a severe bug where OkHttp incorrectly detected and recovered from unhealthy connections. Stale or canceled connections were incorrectly attempted when they shouldn t have been, leading to rare cases of infinite retries. Please upgrade to this release! Fix: don t return stale DNS entries in DnsOverHttps . We were caching DNS results indefinitely rather than the duration specified in the response s cache-control header. Fix: Verify certificate IP addresses in canonical form. When a server presents a TLS certificate containing an IP address we must match that address against the URL s IP address, even when the two addresses are encoded differently, such as 192.168.1.1 and 0::0:0:FFFF:C0A8:101 . Note that OkHttp incorrectly rejected valid certificates resulting in a failure to connect; at no point were invalid certificates accepted. New: OkHttpClient.Builder.minWebSocketMessageToCompress() configures a threshold for compressing outbound web socket messages. Configure this with 0L to always compress outbound messages and Long.MAX_VALUE to never compress outbound messages. The default is 1024L which compresses messages of size 1 KiB and larger. (Inbound messages are compressed or not based on the web socket server s configuration.) New: Defer constructing Inflater and Deflater instances until they are needed. This saves memory if web socket compression is negotiated but not used. Version 4.5.0-RC1 2020-03-17 This release candidate turns on web socket compression. The spec includes a sophisticated mechanism for client and server to negotiate compression features. We strive to offer great performance in our default configuration and so we re making compression the default for everyone starting with this release candidate. Please be considerate of your servers and their operators as you roll out this release. Compression saves bandwidth but it costs CPU and memory! If you run into a problem you may need to adjust or disable the permessage-deflate compression settings on your server. Note that OkHttp won t use compression when sending messages smaller than 1 KiB. Fix: Don t crash when the URL hostname contains an underscore on Android. Fix: Change HTTP/2 to use a daemon thread for its socket reader. If you ve ever seen a command line application hang after all of the work is done, it may be due to a non-daemon thread like this one. New: Include suppressed exceptions when all routes to a target service fail. Version 4.4.1 2020-03-08 Fix: Don t reuse a connection on redirect if certs match but DNS does not. For better locality and performance OkHttp attempts to use the same pooled connection across redirects and follow-ups. It independently shares connections when the IP addresses and certificates match, even if the host names do not. In 4.4.0 we introduced a regression where we shared a connection when certificates matched but the DNS addresses did not. This would only occur when following a redirect from one hostname to another, and where both hosts had common certificates. Fix: Don t fail on a redirect when a client has configured a trust everything trust manager. Typically this would cause certain redirects to fail in debug and development configurations. Version 4.4.0 2020-02-17 New: Support canceled() as an event that can be observed by EventListener . This should be useful for splitting out canceled calls in metrics. New: Publish a bill of materials (BOM) for OkHttp. Depend on this from Gradle or Maven to keep all of your OkHttp artifacts on the same version, even if they re declared via transitive dependencies. You can even omit versions when declaring other OkHttp dependencies. dependencies { api ( platform ( com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-bom:4.4.0 )) api ( com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp ) // No version! api ( com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor ) // No version! } New: Upgrade to Okio 2.4.3. implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.4.3 ) Fix: Limit retry attempts for HTTP/2 REFUSED_STREAM and CANCEL failures. Fix: Retry automatically when incorrectly sharing a connection among multiple hostnames. OkHttp shares connections when hosts share both IP addresses and certificates, such as squareup.com and www.squareup.com . If a server refuses such sharing it will return HTTP 421 and OkHttp will automatically retry on an unshared connection. Fix: Don t crash if a TLS tunnel s response body is truncated. Fix: Don t track unusable routes beyond their usefulness. We had a bug where we could track certain bad routes indefinitely; now we only track the ones that could be necessary. Fix: Defer proxy selection until a proxy is required. This saves calls to ProxySelector on calls that use a pooled connection. Version 4.3.1 2020-01-07 Fix: Don t crash with a NullPointerException when a web socket is closed before it connects. This regression was introduced in OkHttp 4.3.0. Fix: Don t crash with an IllegalArgumentException when using custom trust managers on Android 10. Android uses reflection to look up a magic checkServerTrusted() method and we didn t have it. Fix: Explicitly specify the remote server name when making HTTPS connections on Android 5. In 4.3.0 we introduced a regression where server name indication (SNI) was broken on Android 5. Version 4.3.0 2019-12-31 Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling. Fix: Don t call EventListener.responseHeadersStart() or responseBodyStart() until bytes have been received. Previously these events were incorrectly sent too early, when OkHttp was ready to read the response headers or body, which mislead tracing tools. Note that the responseFailed() event always used to follow one of these events; now it may be sent without them. New: Upgrade to Kotlin 1.3.61. New: Match any number of subdomains with two asterisks in CertificatePinner . For example, **.squareup.com matches us-west.www.squareup.com , www.squareup.com and squareup.com . New: Share threads more aggressively between OkHttp s HTTP/2 connections, connection pool, web sockets, and cache. OkHttp has a new internal task runner abstraction for managed task scheduling. In your debugger you will see new thread names and more use of daemon threads. Fix: Don t drop callbacks on unexpected exceptions. When an interceptor throws an unchecked exception the callback is now notified that the call was canceled. The exception is still sent to the uncaught exception handler for reporting and recovery. Fix: Un-deprecate MockResponse.setHeaders() and other setters. These were deprecated in OkHttp 4.0 but that broke method chaining for Java callers. Fix: Don t crash on HTTP/2 HEAD requests when the Content-Length header is present but is not consistent with the length of the response body. Fix: Don t crash when converting a HttpUrl instance with an unresolvable hostname to a URI. The new behavior strips invalid characters like \" and { from the hostname before converting. Fix: Undo a performance regression introduced in OkHttp 4.0 caused by differences in behavior between Kotlin s assert() and Java s assert() . (Kotlin always evaluates the argument; Java only does when assertions are enabled.) Fix: Honor RequestBody.isOneShot() in HttpLoggingInterceptor . Version 4.2.2 2019-10-06 Fix: When closing a canceled HTTP/2 stream, don t send the END_STREAM flag. This could cause the server to incorrectly interpret the stream as having completed normally. This is most useful when a request body needs to cancel its own call. Version 4.2.1 2019-10-02 Fix: In 4.1.0 we introduced a performance regression that prevented connections from being pooled in certain situations. We have good test coverage for connection pooling but we missed this because it only occurs if you have proxy configured and you share a connection pool among multiple OkHttpClient instances. This particularly-subtle bug was caused by us assigning each OkHttpClient instance its own NullProxySelector when an explicit proxy is configured. But we don t share connections when the proxy selectors are different. Ugh! Version 4.2.0 2019-09-10 New: API to decode a certificate and private key to create a HeldCertificate . This accepts a string containing both a certificate and PKCS #8-encoded private key. val heldCertificate = HeldCertificate . decode ( |-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- |MIIBYTCCAQegAwIBAgIBKjAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjApMRQwEgYDVQQLEwtlbmdpbmVl |cmluZzERMA8GA1UEAxMIY2FzaC5hcHAwHhcNNzAwMTAxMDAwMDA1WhcNNzAwMTAx |MDAwMDEwWjApMRQwEgYDVQQLEwtlbmdpbmVlcmluZzERMA8GA1UEAxMIY2FzaC5h |cHAwWTATBgcqhkjOPQIBBggqhkjOPQMBBwNCAASda8ChkQXxGELnrV/oBnIAx3dD |ocUOJfdz4pOJTP6dVQB9U3UBiW5uSX/MoOD0LL5zG3bVyL3Y6pDwKuYvfLNhoyAw |HjAcBgNVHREBAf8EEjAQhwQBAQEBgghjYXNoLmFwcDAKBggqhkjOPQQDAgNIADBF |AiAyHHg1N6YDDQiY920+cnI5XSZwEGhAtb9PYWO8bLmkcQIhAI2CfEZf3V/obmdT |yyaoEufLKVXhrTQhRfodTeigi4RX |-----END CERTIFICATE----- |-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- |MEECAQAwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcEJzAlAgEBBCA7ODT0xhGSNn4ESj6J |lu/GJQZoU9lDrCPeUcQ28tzOWw== |-----END PRIVATE KEY----- . trimMargin ()) val handshakeCertificates = HandshakeCertificates . Builder () . heldCertificate ( heldCertificate ) . build () val server = MockWebServer () server . useHttps ( handshakeCertificates . sslSocketFactory (), false ) Get these strings with HeldCertificate.certificatePem() and privateKeyPkcs8Pem() . Fix: Handshake now returns peer certificates in canonical order: each certificate is signed by the certificate that follows and the last certificate is signed by a trusted root. Fix: Don t lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this happened enough then eventually the connection would stall. Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to fail the call. Version 4.1.1 2019-09-05 Fix: Don t drop repeated headers when validating cached responses. In our Kotlin upgrade we introduced a regression where we iterated the number of unique header names rather than then number of unique headers. If you re using OkHttp s response cache this may impact you. Version 4.1.0 2019-08-12 OkHttp s new okhttp-brotli module implements Brotli compression. Install the interceptor to enable Brotli compression , which compresses 5-20% smaller than gzip. val client = OkHttpClient.Builder() .addInterceptor(BrotliInterceptor) .build() This artifact has a dependency on Google s Brotli decoder (95 KiB). New: EventListener.proxySelectStart() , proxySelectEnd() events give visibility into the proxy selection process. New: Response.byteString() reads the entire response into memory as a byte string. New: OkHttpClient.x509TrustManager accessor. New: Permit new WebSocket response codes : 1012 (Service Restart), 1013 (Try Again Later), and 1014 (invalid response from the upstream). New: Build with Kotlin 1.3.41, BouncyCastle 1.62, and Conscrypt 2.2.1. Fix: Recover gracefully when a coalesced connection immediately goes unhealthy. Fix: Defer the SecurityException when looking up the default proxy selector. Fix: Don t use brackets formatting IPv6 host names in MockWebServer. Fix: Don t permit cache iterators to remove entries that are being written. Version 4.0.1 2019-07-10 Fix: Tolerate null-hostile lists in public API. Lists created with List.of(...) don t like it when you call contains(null) on them! Fix: Retain binary-compatibility in okhttp3.internal.HttpHeaders.hasBody() . Some unscrupulous coders call this and we don t want their users to suffer. Version 4.0.0 2019-06-26 This release upgrades OkHttp to Kotlin. We tried our best to make fast and safe to upgrade from OkHttp 3.x. We wrote an upgrade guide to help with the migration and a blog post to explain it. Fix: Target Java 8 bytecode for Java and Kotlin. Version 4.0.0-RC3 2019-06-24 Fix: Retain binary-compatibility in okhttp3.internal.HttpMethod . Naughty third party SDKs import this and we want to ease upgrades for their users. Version 4.0.0-RC2 2019-06-21 New: Require Kotlin 1.3.40. New: Change the Kotlin API from File.toRequestBody() to File.asRequestBody() and BufferedSource.toResponseBody() to BufferedSource.asResponseBody() . If the returned value is a view of what created it, we use as . Fix: Permit response codes of zero for compatibility with OkHttp 3.x. Fix: Change the return type of MockWebServer.takeRequest() to be nullable. Fix: Make Call.clone() public to Kotlin callers. Version 4.0.0-RC1 2019-06-03 First stable preview of OkHttp 4.

This is part of our effort to remove the okhttp-tls module s dependency on Bouncy Castle. We think Bouncy Castle is great! But it s a large dependency (6.5 MiB) and its security provider feature impacts VM-wide behavior. New: Reduce contention for applications that make a very high number of concurrent requests. Previously OkHttp used its connection pool as a lock when making changes to connections and calls. With this change each connection is locked independently. Upgrade: Okio 2.7.0 . implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.7.0 ) Fix: Avoid log messages like Didn t find class org.conscrypt.ConscryptHostnameVerifier when detecting the TLS capabilities of the host platform.

Builder () . addPlatformTrustedCertificates () . addInsecureHost ( localhost ) . build () val client = OkHttpClient . Builder () . sslSocketFactory ( clientCertificates . sslSocketFactory (), clientCertificates . trustManager ) . build () New: Add cacheHit , cacheMiss , and cacheConditionalHit() events to EventListener . Use these in logs, metrics, and even test cases to confirm your cache headers are configured as expected. New: Constant string okhttp3.VERSION . This is a string like 4.5.0-RC1 , 4.5.0 , or 4.6.0-SNAPSHOT indicating the version of OkHttp in the current runtime. Use this to include the OkHttp version in custom User-Agent headers. Fix: Don t crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it s running in a JVM or in Android. The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp! Fix: Include the header Accept: text/event-stream for SSE calls. This header is not added if the request already contains an Accept header. Fix: Don t crash with a NullPointerException if a server sends a close while we re sending a ping. OkHttp had a race condition bug.","title":"Version 4.7.0"},{"location":"changelog/#version-460","text":"2020-04-28 Fix: Follow HTTP 307 and 308 redirects on methods other than GET and POST. We re reluctant to change OkHttp s behavior in handling common HTTP status codes, but this fix is overdue! The new behavior is now consistent with RFC 7231 , which is newer than OkHttp itself. If you want this update with the old behavior use this interceptor . Fix: Don t crash decompressing web sockets messages. We had a bug where we assumed deflated bytes in would always yield deflated bytes out and this isn t always the case! Fix: Reliably update and invalidate the disk cache on windows. As originally designed our internal DiskLruCache assumes an inode-like file system, where it s fine to delete files that are currently being read or written. On Windows the file system forbids this so we must be more careful when deleting and renaming files. Fix: Don t crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and above. See Jetty s overview of the API change and its consequences. New: MultipartReader is a streaming decoder for MIME multipart (RFC 2045) messages. It complements MultipartBody which is our streaming encoder. val response : Response = call . execute () val multipartReader = MultipartReader ( response . body !! ) multipartReader . use { while ( true ) { val part = multipartReader . nextPart () ?: break process ( part . headers , part . body ) } } New: MediaType.parameter() gets a parameter like boundary from a media type like multipart/mixed; boundary=\"abc\" . New: Authenticator.JAVA_NET_AUTHENTICATOR forwards authentication requests to java.net.Authenticator . This obsoletes JavaNetAuthenticator in the okhttp-urlconnection module. New: CertificatePinner now offers an API for inspecting the configured pins. Upgrade: Okio 2.6.0 . implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.6.0 ) Upgrade: publicsuffix.org data . This powers HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain() . It s also how OkHttp knows which domains can share cookies with one another. Upgrade: Bouncy Castle 1.65 .

Stale or canceled connections were incorrectly attempted when they shouldn t have been, leading to rare cases of infinite retries. Please upgrade to this release! Fix: don t return stale DNS entries in DnsOverHttps . We were caching DNS results indefinitely rather than the duration specified in the response s cache-control header. Fix: Verify certificate IP addresses in canonical form. When a server presents a TLS certificate containing an IP address we must match that address against the URL s IP address, even when the two addresses are encoded differently, such as 192.168.1.1 and 0::0:0:FFFF:C0A8:101 . Note that OkHttp incorrectly rejected valid certificates resulting in a failure to connect; at no point were invalid certificates accepted. New: OkHttpClient.Builder.minWebSocketMessageToCompress() configures a threshold for compressing outbound web socket messages. Configure this with 0L to always compress outbound messages and Long.MAX_VALUE to never compress outbound messages. The default is 1024L which compresses messages of size 1 KiB and larger. (Inbound messages are compressed or not based on the web socket server s configuration.) New: Defer constructing Inflater and Deflater instances until they are needed.

Please be considerate of your servers and their operators as you roll out this release. Compression saves bandwidth but it costs CPU and memory! If you run into a problem you may need to adjust or disable the permessage-deflate compression settings on your server. Note that OkHttp won t use compression when sending messages smaller than 1 KiB. Fix: Don t crash when the URL hostname contains an underscore on Android. Fix: Change HTTP/2 to use a daemon thread for its socket reader. If you ve ever seen a command line application hang after all of the work is done, it may be due to a non-daemon thread like this one.

For better locality and performance OkHttp attempts to use the same pooled connection across redirects and follow-ups. It independently shares connections when the IP addresses and certificates match, even if the host names do not. In 4.4.0 we introduced a regression where we shared a connection when certificates matched but the DNS addresses did not. This would only occur when following a redirect from one hostname to another, and where both hosts had common certificates.

You can even omit versions when declaring other OkHttp dependencies. dependencies { api ( platform ( com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-bom:4.4.0 )) api ( com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp ) // No version! api ( com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor ) // No version! } New: Upgrade to Okio 2.4.3. implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:2.4.3 ) Fix: Limit retry attempts for HTTP/2 REFUSED_STREAM and CANCEL failures. Fix: Retry automatically when incorrectly sharing a connection among multiple hostnames. OkHttp shares connections when hosts share both IP addresses and certificates, such as squareup.com and www.squareup.com . If a server refuses such sharing it will return HTTP 421 and OkHttp will automatically retry on an unshared connection. Fix: Don t crash if a TLS tunnel s response body is truncated. Fix: Don t track unusable routes beyond their usefulness. We had a bug where we could track certain bad routes indefinitely; now we only track the ones that could be necessary.

When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling. Fix: Don t call EventListener.responseHeadersStart() or responseBodyStart() until bytes have been received. Previously these events were incorrectly sent too early, when OkHttp was ready to read the response headers or body, which mislead tracing tools. Note that the responseFailed() event always used to follow one of these events; now it may be sent without them. New: Upgrade to Kotlin 1.3.61. New: Match any number of subdomains with two asterisks in CertificatePinner . For example, **.squareup.com matches us-west.www.squareup.com , www.squareup.com and squareup.com . New: Share threads more aggressively between OkHttp s HTTP/2 connections, connection pool, web sockets, and cache. OkHttp has a new internal task runner abstraction for managed task scheduling. In your debugger you will see new thread names and more use of daemon threads. Fix: Don t drop callbacks on unexpected exceptions.

This prevents a potential crash when using certificate pinning with the Google Play Services security provider. Version 2.7.4 2016-02-07 Fix: Don t crash when finding the trust manager if the Play Services (GMS) security provider is installed. Fix: The previous release introduced a performance regression on Android, caused by looking up CA certificates. This is now fixed. Version 2.7.3 2016-02-06 Fix: Permit the trusted CA root to be pinned by CertificatePinner . Version 2.7.2 2016-01-07 Fix: Don t eagerly release stream allocations on cache hits. We might still need them to handle redirects. Version 2.7.1 2016-01-01 Fix: Don t do a health check on newly-created connections. This is unnecessary work that could put the client in an inconsistent state if the health check fails. Version 2.7.0 2015-12-13 Rewritten connection management. Previously OkHttp s connection pool managed both idle and active connections for HTTP/2, but only idle connections for HTTP/1.x. With this update the connection pool manages both idle and active connections for everything. OkHttp now detects and warns on connections that were allocated but never released, and will enforce HTTP/2 stream limits. This update also fixes Call.cancel() to not do I/O on the calling thread. Fix: Don t log gzipped data in the logging interceptor. Fix: Don t resolve DNS addresses when connecting through a SOCKS proxy. Fix: Drop the synthetic OkHttp-Selected-Protocol response header. Fix: Support 204 and 205 No Content replies in the logging interceptor. New: Add Call.isExecuted() . Version 2.6.0 2015-11-22 New Logging Interceptor. The logging-interceptor subproject offers simple request and response logging. It may be configured to log headers and bodies for debugging. It requires this Maven dependency: dependency groupId com.squareup.okhttp /groupId artifactId logging-interceptor /artifactId version 2.6.0 /version /dependency Configure basic logging like this: HttpLoggingInterceptor loggingInterceptor = new HttpLoggingInterceptor (); loggingInterceptor . setLevel ( HttpLoggingInterceptor . Level . BASIC ); client . networkInterceptors (). add ( loggingInterceptor ); Warning: Avoid Level.HEADERS and Level.BODY in production because they could leak passwords and other authentication credentials to insecure logs. WebSocket API now uses RequestBody and ResponseBody for messages. This is a backwards-incompatible API change. The DNS service is now pluggable. In some situations this may be useful to manually prioritize specific IP addresses. Fix: Don t throw when converting an HttpUrl to a java.net.URI . Previously URLs with special characters like | and [ would break when subjected to URI\u2019s overly-strict validation. Fix: Don t re-encode + as %20 in encoded URL query strings. OkHttp prefers %20 when doing its own encoding, but will retain + when that is provided. Fix: Enforce that callers call WebSocket.close() on IO errors. Error handling in WebSockets is significantly improved. Fix: Don t use SPDY/3 style header concatenation for HTTP/2 request headers. This could have corrupted requests where multiple headers had the same name, as in cookies. Fix: Reject bad characters in the URL hostname. Previously characters like \\0 would cause a late crash when building the request. Fix: Allow interceptors to change the request method. Fix: Don\u2019t use the request s User-Agent or Proxy-Authorization when connecting to an HTTPS server via an HTTP tunnel. The Proxy-Authorization header was being leaked to the origin server. Fix: Digits may be used in a URL scheme. Fix: Improve connection timeout recovery. Fix: Recover from getsockname crashes impacting Android releases prior to 4.2.2. Fix: Drop partial support for HTTP/1.0. Previously OkHttp would send HTTP/1.0 on connections after seeing a response with HTTP/1.0 . The fixed behavior is consistent with Firefox and Chrome. Fix: Allow a body in OPTIONS requests. Fix: Don t percent-encode non-ASCII characters in URL fragments. Fix: Handle null fragments. Fix: Don\u2019t crash on interceptors that throw IOException before a connection is attempted. New: Support WebDAV HTTP methods. New: Buffer WebSocket frames for better performance. New: Drop support for TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA , our only remaining DSS cipher suite. This is consistent with Firefox and Chrome which have also dropped these cipher suite. Version 2.5.0 2015-08-25 Timeouts now default to 10 seconds. Previously we defaulted to never timing out, and that was a lousy policy. If establishing a connection, reading the next byte from a connection, or writing the next byte to a connection takes more than 10 seconds to complete, you\u2019ll need to adjust the timeouts manually. OkHttp now rejects request headers that contain invalid characters. This includes potential security problems (newline characters) as well as simple non-ASCII characters (including international characters and emoji). Call canceling is more reliable. We had a bug where a socket being connected wasn t being closed when the application used Call.cancel() . Changing a HttpUrl\u2019s scheme now tracks the default port. We had a bug where changing a URL from http to https would leave it on port 80. Okio has been updated to 1.6.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.6.0 /version /dependency New: Cache.initialize() . Call this on a background thread to eagerly initialize the response cache. New: Fold MockWebServerRule into MockWebServer . This makes it easier to write JUnit tests with MockWebServer . The MockWebServer library now depends on JUnit, though it continues to work with all testing frameworks. Fix: FormEncodingBuilder is now consistent with browsers in which characters it escapes. Previously we weren\u2019t percent-encoding commas, parens, and other characters. Fix: Relax FormEncodingBuilder to support building empty forms. Fix: Timeouts throw SocketTimeoutException , not InterruptedIOException . Fix: Change MockWebServer to use the same logic as OkHttp when determining whether an HTTP request permits a body. Fix: HttpUrl now uses the canonical form for IPv6 addresses. Fix: Use HttpUrl internally. Fix: Recover from Android 4.2.2 EBADF crashes. Fix: Don t crash with an IllegalStateException if an HTTP/2 or SPDY write fails, leaving the connection in an inconsistent state. Fix: Make sure the default user agent is ASCII. Version 2.4.0 2015-05-22 Forbid response bodies on HTTP 204 and 205 responses. Webservers that return such malformed responses will now trigger a ProtocolException in the client. WebSocketListener has incompatible changes. The onOpen() method is now called on the reader thread, so implementations must return before further websocket messages will be delivered. The onFailure() method now includes an HTTP response if one was returned. Version 2.4.0-RC1 2015-05-16 New HttpUrl API. It s like java.net.URL but good. Note that Request.Builder.url() now throws IllegalArgumentException on malformed URLs. (Previous releases would throw a MalformedURLException when calling a malformed URL.) We ve improved connect failure recovery. We now differentiate between setup, connecting, and connected and implement appropriate recovery rules for each. This changes Address to no longer use ConnectionSpec . (This is an incompatible API change). FormEncodingBuilder now uses %20 instead of + for encoded spaces. Both are permitted-by-spec, but %20 requires fewer special cases. Okio has been updated to 1.4.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.4.0 /version /dependency Request.Builder no longer accepts null if a request body is required. Passing null will now fail for request methods that require a body. Instead use an empty body such as this one: RequestBody . create ( null , new byte [ 0 ] ); CertificatePinner now supports wildcard hostnames. As always with certificate pinning, you must be very careful to avoid bricking your app. You ll need to pin both the top-level domain and the *. domain for full coverage. client . setCertificatePinner ( new CertificatePinner . Builder () . add ( publicobject.com , sha1/DmxUShsZuNiqPQsX2Oi9uv2sCnw= ) . add ( *.publicobject.com , sha1/DmxUShsZuNiqPQsX2Oi9uv2sCnw= ) . add ( publicobject.com , sha1/SXxoaOSEzPC6BgGmxAt/EAcsajw= ) . add ( *.publicobject.com , sha1/SXxoaOSEzPC6BgGmxAt/EAcsajw= ) . add ( publicobject.com , sha1/blhOM3W9V/bVQhsWAcLYwPU6n24= ) . add ( *.publicobject.com , sha1/blhOM3W9V/bVQhsWAcLYwPU6n24= ) . add ( publicobject.com , sha1/T5x9IXmcrQ7YuQxXnxoCmeeQ84c= ) . add ( *.publicobject.com , sha1/T5x9IXmcrQ7YuQxXnxoCmeeQ84c= ) . build ()); Interceptors lists are now deep-copied by OkHttpClient.clone() . Previously clones shared interceptors, which made it difficult to customize the interceptors on a request-by-request basis. New: Headers.toMultimap() . New: RequestBody.create(MediaType, ByteString) . New: ConnectionSpec.isCompatible(SSLSocket) . New: Dispatcher.getQueuedCallCount() and Dispatcher.getRunningCallCount() . These can be useful in diagnostics. Fix: OkHttp no longer shares timeouts between pooled connections. This was causing some applications to crash when connections were reused. Fix: OkApacheClient now allows an empty PUT and POST . Fix: Websockets no longer rebuffer socket streams. Fix: Websockets are now better at handling close frames. Fix: Content type matching is now case insensitive. Fix: Vary headers are not lost with android.net.http.HttpResponseCache . Fix: HTTP/2 wasn t enforcing stream timeouts when writing the underlying connection. Now it is. Fix: Never return null on call.proceed() . This was a bug in call cancelation. Fix: When a network interceptor mutates a request, that change is now reflected in Response.networkResponse() . Fix: Badly-behaving caches now throw a checked exception instead of a NullPointerException . Fix: Better handling of uncaught exceptions in MockWebServer with HTTP/2. Version 2.3.0 2015-03-16 HTTP/2 support. We ve done interop testing and haven t seen any problems. HTTP/2 support has been a big effort and we re particularly thankful to Adrian Cole who has helped us to reach this milestone. RC4 cipher suites are no longer supported by default. To connect to old, obsolete servers relying on these cipher suites, you must create a custom ConnectionSpec . Beta WebSockets support. . The okhttp-ws subproject offers a new websockets client. Please try it out! When it s ready we intend to include it with the core OkHttp library. Okio updated to 1.3.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.3.0 /version /dependency Fix: improve parallelism of async requests. OkHttp s Dispatcher had a misconfigured ExecutorService that limited the number of worker threads. If you re using Call.enqueue() this update should significantly improve request concurrency. Fix: Lazily initialize the response cache. This avoids strict mode warnings when initializing OkHttp on Android\u2018s main thread. Fix: Disable ALPN on Android 4.4. That release of the feature was unstable and prone to native crashes in the underlying OpenSSL code. Fix: Don t send both If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since cache headers when both are applicable. Fix: Fail early when a port is out of range. Fix: Offer Content-Length headers for multipart request bodies. Fix: Throw UnknownServiceException if a cleartext connection is attempted when explicitly forbidden. Fix: Throw a SSLPeerUnverifiedException when host verification fails. Fix: MockWebServer explicitly closes sockets. (On some Android releases, closing the input stream and output stream of a socket is not sufficient. Fix: Buffer outgoing HTTP/2 frames to limit how many outgoing frames are created. Fix: Avoid crashing when cache writing fails due to a full disk. Fix: Improve caching of private responses. Fix: Update cache-by-default response codes. Fix: Reused Request.Builder instances no longer hold stale URL fields. New: ConnectionSpec can now be configured to use the SSL socket s default cipher suites. To use, set the cipher suites to null . New: Support DELETE with a request body. New: Headers.of(Map) creates headers from a Map. Version 2.2.0 2014-12-30 RequestBody.contentLength() now throws IOException . This is a source-incompatible change. If you have code that calls RequestBody.contentLength() , your compile will break with this update. The change is binary-compatible, however: code compiled for OkHttp 2.0 and 2.1 will continue to work with this update. COMPATIBLE_TLS no longer supports SSLv3. In response to the POODLE vulnerability, OkHttp no longer offers SSLv3 when negotiation an HTTPS connection. If you continue to need to connect to webservers running SSLv3, you must manually configure your own ConnectionSpec . OkHttp now offers interceptors. Interceptors are a powerful mechanism that can monitor, rewrite, and retry calls. The interceptors doc is a full introduction to this new API. New: APIs to iterate and selectively clear the response cache. New: Support for SOCKS proxies. New: Support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV . New: Update HTTP/2 support to h2-16 and hpack-10 . New: APIs to prevent retrying non-idempotent requests. Fix: Drop NPN support. Going forward we support ALPN only. Fix: The hostname verifier is now strict. This is consistent with the hostname verifier in modern browsers. Fix: Improve CONNECT handling for misbehaving HTTP proxies. Fix: Don t retry requests that failed due to timeouts. Fix: Cache 302s and 308s that include appropriate response headers. Fix: Improve pooling of connections that use proxy selectors. Fix: Don t leak connections when using ALPN on the desktop. Fix: Update Jetty ALPN to 7.1.2.v20141202 (Java 7) and 8.1.2.v20141202 (Java 8). This fixes a bug in resumed TLS sessions where the wrong protocol could be selected. Fix: Don t crash in SPDY and HTTP/2 when disconnecting before connecting. Fix: Avoid a reverse DNS-lookup for a numeric proxy address Fix: Resurrect http/2 frame logging. Fix: Limit to 20 authorization attempts. Version 2.1.0 2014-11-11 New: Typesafe APIs for interacting with cipher suites and TLS versions. Fix: Don t crash when mixing authorization challenges with upload retries. Version 2.1.0-RC1 2014-11-04 OkHttp now caches private responses . We ve changed from a shared cache to a private cache, and will now store responses that use an Authorization header. This means OkHttp s cache shouldn t be used on middleboxes that sit between user agents and the origin server. TLS configuration updated. OkHttp now explicitly enables TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 where they are supported. It will continue to perform only one fallback, to SSLv3. Applications can now configure this with the ConnectionSpec class. To disable TLS fallback: client . setConnectionSpecs ( Arrays . asList ( ConnectionSpec . MODERN_TLS , ConnectionSpec . CLEARTEXT )); To disable cleartext connections, permitting https URLs only: client . setConnectionSpecs ( Arrays . asList ( ConnectionSpec . MODERN_TLS , ConnectionSpec . COMPATIBLE_TLS )); New cipher suites. Please confirm that your webservers are reachable with this limited set of cipher suites.

Be warned, certificate pinning is dangerous and could prevent your application from trusting your server! Cache improvements. This release fixes some severe cache problems including a bug where the cache could be corrupted upon certain access patterns. We also fixed a bug where the cache was being cleared due to a corrupted journal. We ve added APIs to configure a request s Cache-Control headers, and to manually clear the cache. Request cancellation fixes. This update fixes a bug where synchronous requests couldn t be canceled by tag. This update avoids crashing when onResponse() throws an IOException . That failure will now be logged instead of notifying the thread s uncaught exception handler. We ve added a new API, Call.isCanceled() to check if a call has been canceled. New: Update MultipartBuilder to support content length. New: Make it possible to mock OkHttpClient and Call . New: Update to h2-14 and hpack-9. New: OkHttp includes a user-agent by default, like okhttp/2.1.0-RC1 . Fix: Handle response code 308 Permanent Redirect . Fix: Don t skip the callback if a call is canceled. Fix: Permit hostnames with underscores. Fix: Permit overriding the content-type in OkApacheClient . Fix: Use the socket factory for direct connections. Fix: Honor OkUrlFactory APIs that disable redirects. Fix: Don t crash on concurrent modification of SPDY SPDY settings. Version 2.0.0 This release commits to a stable 2.0 API. Read the 2.0.0-RC1 changes for advice on upgrading from 1.x to 2.x. 2014-06-21 API Change : Use IOException in Callback.onFailure() . This is a source-incompatible change, and is different from OkHttp 2.0.0-RC2 which used Throwable . Fix: Fixed a caching bug where we weren t storing rewritten request headers like Accept-Encoding . Fix: Fixed bugs in handling the SPDY window size. This was stalling certain large downloads Update the language level to Java 7. (OkHttp requires Android 2.3+ or Java 7+.) Version 2.0.0-RC2 2014-06-11 This update fixes problems in 2.0.0-RC1. Read the 2.0.0-RC1 changes for advice on upgrading from 1.x to 2.x. Fix: Don t leak connections! There was a regression in 2.0.0-RC1 where connections were neither closed nor pooled. Fix: Revert builder-style return types from OkHttpClient s timeout methods for binary compatibility with OkHttp 1.x. Fix: Don t skip client stream 1 on SPDY/3.1. This fixes SPDY connectivity to https://google.com , which doesn t follow the SPDY/3.1 spec! Fix: Always configure NPN headers. This fixes connectivity to https://facebook.com when SPDY and HTTP/2 are both disabled. Otherwise an unexpected NPN response is received and OkHttp crashes. Fix: Write continuation frames when HPACK data is larger than 16383 bytes. Fix: Don t drop uncaught exceptions thrown in async calls. Fix: Throw an exception eagerly when a request body is not legal. Previously we ignored the problem at request-building time, only to crash later with a NullPointerException . Fix: Include a backwards-compatible OkHttp-Response-Source header with OkUrlFactory responses. Fix: Don t include a default User-Agent header in requests made with the Call API. Requests made with OkUrlFactory will continue to have a default user agent. New: Guava-like API to create headers: Headers headers = Headers . of ( name1 , value1 , name2 , value2 , ...). New: Make the content-type header optional for request bodies. New: Response.isSuccessful() is a convenient API to check response codes. New: The response body can now be read outside of the callback. Response bodies must always be closed, otherwise they will leak connections! New: APIs to create multipart request bodies ( MultipartBuilder ) and form encoding bodies ( FormEncodingBuilder ). Version 2.0.0-RC1 2014-05-23 OkHttp 2 is designed around a new API that is true to HTTP, with classes for requests, responses, headers, and calls. It uses modern Java patterns like immutability and chained builders. The API now offers asynchronous callbacks in addition to synchronous blocking calls. API Changes New Request and Response types, each with their own builder. There s also a RequestBody class to write the request body to the network and a ResponseBody to read the response body from the network. The standalone Headers class offers full access to the HTTP headers. Okio dependency added. OkHttp now depends on Okio , an I/O library that makes it easier to access, store and process data. Using this library internally makes OkHttp faster while consuming less memory. You can write a RequestBody as an Okio BufferedSink and a ResponseBody as an Okio BufferedSource . Standard InputStream and OutputStream access is also available. New Call and Callback types execute requests and receive their responses. Both types of calls can be canceled via the Call or the OkHttpClient . URLConnection support has moved to the okhttp-urlconnection module. If you re upgrading from 1.x, this change will impact you. You will need to add the okhttp-urlconnection module to your project and use the OkUrlFactory to create new instances of HttpURLConnection : // OkHttp 1.x: HttpURLConnection connection = client . open ( url ); // OkHttp 2.x: HttpURLConnection connection = new OkUrlFactory ( client ). open ( url ); Custom caches are no longer supported. In OkHttp 1.x it was possible to define your own response cache with the java.net.ResponseCache and OkHttp s OkResponseCache interfaces. Both of these APIs have been dropped. In OkHttp 2 the built-in disk cache is the only supported response cache. HttpResponseCache has been renamed to Cache. Install it with OkHttpClient.setCache(...) instead of OkHttpClient.setResponseCache(...) . OkAuthenticator has been replaced with Authenticator. This new authenticator has access to the full incoming response and can respond with whichever followup request is appropriate. The Challenge class is now a top-level class and Credential is replaced with a utility class called Credentials . OkHttpClient.getFollowProtocolRedirects() renamed to getFollowSslRedirects() . We reserve the word protocol for the HTTP version being used (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2). The old name of this method was misleading; it was always used to configure redirects between https:// and http:// schemes. RouteDatabase is no longer public API. OkHttp continues to track which routes have failed but this is no exposed in the API. ResponseSource is gone. This enum exposed whether a response came from the cache, network, or both. OkHttp 2 offers more detail with raw access to the cache and network responses in the new Response class. TunnelRequest is gone. It specified how to connect to an HTTP proxy. OkHttp 2 uses the new Request class for this. Dispatcher is a new class that manages the queue of asynchronous calls. It implements limits on total in-flight calls and in-flight calls per host. Implementation changes Support Android TrafficStats socket tagging. Drop authentication headers on redirect. Added support for compressed data frames. Process push promise callbacks in order. Update to http/2 draft 12. Update to HPACK draft 07. Add ALPN support. Maven will use ALPN on OpenJDK 8. Update NPN dependency to target jdk7u60-b13 and Oracle jdk7u55-b13 . Ensure SPDY variants support zero-length DELETE and POST. Prevent leaking a cache item s InputStreams when metadata read fails. Use a string to identify TLS versions in routes. Add frame logger for HTTP/2. Replacing httpMinorVersion with Protocol . Expose HTTP/1.0 as a potential protocol. Use Protocol to describe framing. Implement write timeouts for HTTP/1.1 streams. Avoid use of SPDY stream ID 1, as that s typically used for UPGRADE. Support OAuth in Authenticator . Permit a dangling semicolon in media type parsing.

WebSocket API now uses RequestBody and ResponseBody for messages. This is a backwards-incompatible API change. The DNS service is now pluggable. In some situations this may be useful to manually prioritize specific IP addresses. Fix: Don t throw when converting an HttpUrl to a java.net.URI . Previously URLs with special characters like | and [ would break when subjected to URI\u2019s overly-strict validation. Fix: Don t re-encode + as %20 in encoded URL query strings. OkHttp prefers %20 when doing its own encoding, but will retain + when that is provided. Fix: Enforce that callers call WebSocket.close() on IO errors. Error handling in WebSockets is significantly improved. Fix: Don t use SPDY/3 style header concatenation for HTTP/2 request headers. This could have corrupted requests where multiple headers had the same name, as in cookies. Fix: Reject bad characters in the URL hostname. Previously characters like \\0 would cause a late crash when building the request. Fix: Allow interceptors to change the request method. Fix: Don\u2019t use the request s User-Agent or Proxy-Authorization when connecting to an HTTPS server via an HTTP tunnel. The Proxy-Authorization header was being leaked to the origin server. Fix: Digits may be used in a URL scheme. Fix: Improve connection timeout recovery. Fix: Recover from getsockname crashes impacting Android releases prior to 4.2.2.

Previously we defaulted to never timing out, and that was a lousy policy. If establishing a connection, reading the next byte from a connection, or writing the next byte to a connection takes more than 10 seconds to complete, you\u2019ll need to adjust the timeouts manually. OkHttp now rejects request headers that contain invalid characters. This includes potential security problems (newline characters) as well as simple non-ASCII characters (including international characters and emoji). Call canceling is more reliable. We had a bug where a socket being connected wasn t being closed when the application used Call.cancel() . Changing a HttpUrl\u2019s scheme now tracks the default port.

There s also a RequestBody class to write the request body to the network and a ResponseBody to read the response body from the network. The standalone Headers class offers full access to the HTTP headers. Okio dependency added. OkHttp now depends on Okio , an I/O library that makes it easier to access, store and process data. Using this library internally makes OkHttp faster while consuming less memory. You can write a RequestBody as an Okio BufferedSink and a ResponseBody as an Okio BufferedSource . Standard InputStream and OutputStream access is also available. New Call and Callback types execute requests and receive their responses. Both types of calls can be canceled via the Call or the OkHttpClient . URLConnection support has moved to the okhttp-urlconnection module. If you re upgrading from 1.x, this change will impact you. You will need to add the okhttp-urlconnection module to your project and use the OkUrlFactory to create new instances of HttpURLConnection : // OkHttp 1.x: HttpURLConnection connection = client . open ( url ); // OkHttp 2.x: HttpURLConnection connection = new OkUrlFactory ( client ). open ( url ); Custom caches are no longer supported. In OkHttp 1.x it was possible to define your own response cache with the java.net.ResponseCache and OkHttp s OkResponseCache interfaces. Both of these APIs have been dropped. In OkHttp 2 the built-in disk cache is the only supported response cache. HttpResponseCache has been renamed to Cache. Install it with OkHttpClient.setCache(...) instead of OkHttpClient.setResponseCache(...) . OkAuthenticator has been replaced with Authenticator. This new authenticator has access to the full incoming response and can respond with whichever followup request is appropriate. The Challenge class is now a top-level class and Credential is replaced with a utility class called Credentials . OkHttpClient.getFollowProtocolRedirects() renamed to getFollowSslRedirects() .

Version 3.14.6 2020-01-11 Fix: Don t crash if the connection is closed when sending a degraded ping. This fixes a regression that was introduced in OkHttp 3.14.5. Version 3.14.5 2020-01-03 Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling. Version 3.14.4 2019-09-29 Fix: Cancel calls that fail due to unexpected exceptions. We had a bug where an enqueued call would never call back if it crashed with an unchecked throwable, such as a NullPointerException or OutOfMemoryError . We now call Callback.onFailure() with an IOException that reports the call as canceled. The triggering exception is still delivered to the thread s UncaughtExceptionHandler . Fix: Don t evict incomplete entries when iterating the cache. We had a bug where iterating Cache.urls() would prevent in-flight entries from being written. Version 3.14.3 2019-09-10 Fix: Don t lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this happened enough then eventually the connection would stall. Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to fail the call. Fix: Recover gracefully when a coalesced connection immediately goes unhealthy. Version 3.14.2 2019-05-19 Fix: Lock in a route when recovering from an HTTP/2 connection error. We had a bug where two calls that failed at the same time could cause OkHttp to crash with a NoSuchElementException instead of the expected IOException . Fix: Don t crash with a NullPointerException when formatting an error message describing a truncated response from an HTTPS proxy. Version 3.14.1 2019-04-10 Fix: Don t crash when an interceptor retries when there are no more routes. This was an edge-case regression introduced with the events cleanup in 3.14.0. Fix: Provide actionable advice when the exchange is non-null. Prior to 3.14, OkHttp would silently leak connections when an interceptor retries without closing the response body. With 3.14 we detect this problem but the exception was not helpful. Version 3.14.0 2019-03-14 This release deletes the long-deprecated OkUrlFactory and OkApacheClient APIs. These facades hide OkHttp s implementation behind another client s API. If you still need this please copy and paste ObsoleteUrlFactory.java or ObsoleteApacheClient.java into your project. OkHttp now supports duplex calls over HTTP/2. With normal HTTP calls the request must finish before the response starts. With duplex, request and response bodies are transmitted simultaneously. This can be used to implement interactive conversations within a single HTTP call. Create duplex calls by overriding the new RequestBody.isDuplex() method to return true. This simple option dramatically changes the behavior of the request body and of the entire call. The RequestBody.writeTo() method may now retain a reference to the provided sink and hand it off to another thread to write to it after writeTo returns. The EventListener may now see requests and responses interleaved in ways not previously permitted. For example, a listener may receive responseHeadersStart() followed by requestBodyEnd() , both on the same call. Such events may be triggered by different threads even for a single call. Interceptors that rewrite or replace the request body may now inadvertently interfere with duplex request bodies. Such interceptors should check RequestBody.isDuplex() and avoid accessing the request body when it is. Duplex calls require HTTP/2. If HTTP/1 is established instead the duplex call will fail. The most common use of duplex calls is gRPC . New: Prevent OkHttp from retransmitting a request body by overriding RequestBody.isOneShot() . This is most useful when writing the request body is destructive. New: We ve added requestFailed() and responseFailed() methods to EventListener . These are called instead of requestBodyEnd() and responseBodyEnd() in some failure situations. They may also be fired in cases where no event was published previously. In this release we did an internal rewrite of our event code to fix problems where events were lost or unbalanced. Fix: Don t leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the onFailure() callback. Fix: Apply call timeouts when connecting duplex calls, web sockets, and server-sent events. Once the streams are established no further timeout is enforced. Fix: Retain the Route when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was causing some Authenticator calls to see a null route when non-null was expected. Fix: Use the correct key size in the name of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 which is a TLS 1.3 cipher suite. We accidentally specified a key size of 256, preventing that cipher suite from being selected for any TLS handshakes. We didn t notice because this cipher suite isn t supported on Android, Java, or Conscrypt. We removed this cipher suite and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 from the restricted, modern, and compatible sets of cipher suites. These two cipher suites aren t enabled by default in either Firefox or Chrome. See our TLS Configuration History tracker for a log of all changes to OkHttp s default TLS options. New: Upgrade to Conscrypt 2.0.0. OkHttp works with other versions of Conscrypt but this is the version we re testing against. implementation ( org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber:2.0.0 ) New: Update the embedded public suffixes list. Version 3.13.1 2019-02-05 Fix: Don t crash when using a custom X509TrustManager or SSLSocket on Android. When we removed obsolete code for Android 4.4 we inadvertently also removed support for custom subclasses. We ve restored that support! Version 3.13.0 2019-02-04 This release bumps our minimum requirements to Java 8+ or Android 5+. Cutting off old devices is a serious change and we don t do it lightly! This post explains why we re doing this and how to upgrade. The OkHttp 3.12.x branch will be our long-term branch for Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java 7+. These platforms lack support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is difficult we will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2021. (This commitment was originally through December 31, 2020; we have since extended it.) TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are no longer enabled by default. Major web browsers are working towards removing these versions altogether in early 2020. If your servers aren t ready yet you can configure OkHttp 3.13 to allow TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connections: OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder() .connectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS)) .build(); New: You can now access HTTP trailers with Response.trailers() . This method may only be called after the entire HTTP response body has been read. New: Upgrade to Okio 1.17.3. If you re on Kotlin-friendly Okio 2.x this release requires 2.2.2 or newer. implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:1.17.3 ) Fix: Don t miss cancels when sending HTTP/2 request headers. Fix: Don t miss whole operation timeouts when calls redirect. Fix: Don t leak connections if web sockets have malformed responses or if onOpen() throws. Fix: Don t retry when request bodies fail due to FileNotFoundException . Fix: Don t crash when URLs have IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. Fix: Don t crash when building HandshakeCertificates on Android API 28. Fix: Permit multipart file names to contain non-ASCII characters. New: API to get MockWebServer s dispatcher. New: API to access headers as java.time.Instant . New: Fail fast if a SSLSocketFactory is used as a SocketFactory . New: Log the TLS handshake in LoggingEventListener . Version 3.12.12 2020-05-17 Fix: Don t crash when running as a plugin in Android Studio Canary 4.1. To enable platform-specific TLS features OkHttp must detect whether it s running in a JVM or in Android. The upcoming Android Studio runs in a JVM but has classes from Android and that confused OkHttp! Version 3.12.11 2020-04-28 Fix: Don t crash on Java 8u252 which introduces an API previously found only on Java 9 and above. See Jetty s overview of the API change and its consequences. Version 3.12.10 2020-02-29 Fix: Don t crash on Android 4.1 when detecting methods that became restricted in Android 11. Supporting a full decade of Android releases on our 3.12.x branch is tricky! Version 3.12.9 2020-02-24 Fix: Don t crash on Android 11 due to use of restricted methods. This prevents a crash with the exception, Expected Android API level 21+ but was 29 . Version 3.12.8 2020-01-11 Fix: Don t crash if the connection is closed when sending a degraded ping. This fixes a regression that was introduced in OkHttp 3.12.7. Version 3.12.7 2020-01-03 Fix: Degrade HTTP/2 connections after a timeout. When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact the stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after a stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling. Version 3.12.6 2019-09-29 Fix: Cancel calls that fail due to unexpected exceptions. We had a bug where an enqueued call would never call back if it crashed with an unchecked throwable, such as a NullPointerException or OutOfMemoryError . We now call Callback.onFailure() with an IOException that reports the call as canceled. The triggering exception is still delivered to the thread s UncaughtExceptionHandler . Fix: Don t evict incomplete entries when iterating the cache. We had a bug where iterating Cache.urls() would prevent in-flight entries from being written. Version 3.12.5 2019-09-10 Fix: Don t lose HTTP/2 flow control bytes when incoming data races with a stream close. If this happened enough then eventually the connection would stall. Fix: Acknowledge and apply inbound HTTP/2 settings atomically. Previously we had a race where we could use new flow control capacity before acknowledging it, causing strict HTTP/2 servers to fail the call. Version 3.12.4 2019-09-04 Fix: Don t crash looking up an absent class on certain buggy Android 4.x devices. Version 3.12.3 2019-05-07 Fix: Permit multipart file names to contain non-ASCII characters. Fix: Retain the Route when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was causing some Authenticator calls to see a null route when non-null was expected. Version 3.12.2 2019-03-14 Fix: Don t crash if the HTTPS server returns no certificates in the TLS handshake. Fix: Don t leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the onFailure() callback. Version 3.12.1 2018-12-23 Fix: Remove overlapping package-info.java . This caused issues with some build tools. Version 3.12.0 2018-11-16 OkHttp now supports TLS 1.3. This requires either Conscrypt or Java 11+. Proxy authenticators are now asked for preemptive authentication. OkHttp will now request authentication credentials before creating TLS tunnels through HTTP proxies (HTTP CONNECT ). Authenticators should identify preemptive authentications by the presence of a challenge whose scheme is OkHttp-Preemptive . OkHttp now offers full-operation timeouts. This sets a limit on how long the entire call may take and covers resolving DNS, connecting, writing the request body, server processing, and reading the full response body. If a call requires redirects or retries all must complete within one timeout period. Use OkHttpClient.Builder.callTimeout() to specify the default duration and Call.timeout() to specify the timeout of an individual call. New: Return values and fields are now non-null unless otherwise annotated. New: LoggingEventListener makes it easy to get basic visibility into a call s performance. This class is in the logging-interceptor artifact. New: Headers.Builder.addUnsafeNonAscii() allows non-ASCII values to be added without an immediate exception. New: Headers can be redacted in HttpLoggingInterceptor . New: Headers.Builder now accepts dates. New: OkHttp now accepts java.time.Duration for timeouts on Java 8+ and Android 26+. New: Challenge includes all authentication parameters. New: Upgrade to BouncyCastle 1.60, Conscrypt 1.4.0, and Okio 1.15.0. We don t yet require Kotlin-friendly Okio 2.x but OkHttp works fine with that series. implementation ( org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.60 ) implementation ( org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber:1.4.0 ) implementation ( com.squareup.okio:okio:1.15.0 ) Fix: Handle dispatcher executor shutdowns gracefully. When there aren t any threads to carry a call its callback now gets a RejectedExecutionException . Fix: Don t permanently cache responses with Cache-Control: immutable . We misunderstood the original immutable proposal! Fix: Change Authenticator s Route parameter to be nullable. This was marked as non-null but could be called with null in some cases. Fix: Don t create malformed URLs when MockWebServer is reached via an IPv6 address. Fix: Don t crash if the system default authenticator is null. Fix: Don t crash generating elliptic curve certificates on Android. Fix: Don t crash doing platform detection on RoboVM. Fix: Don t leak socket connections when web socket upgrades fail. Version 3.11.0 2018-07-12 OkHttp s new okhttp-tls submodule tames HTTPS and TLS. HeldCertificate is a TLS certificate and its private key. Generate a certificate with its builder then use it to sign another certificate or perform a TLS handshake. The certificatePem() method encodes the certificate in the familiar PEM format ( --- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- ); the privateKeyPkcs8Pem() does likewise for the private key. HandshakeCertificates holds the TLS certificates required for a TLS handshake. On the server it keeps your HeldCertificate and its chain. On the client it keeps the root certificates that are trusted to sign a server s certificate chain. HandshakeCertificates also works with mutual TLS where these roles are reversed. These classes make it possible to enable HTTPS in MockWebServer in just a few lines of code . OkHttp now supports prior knowledge cleartext HTTP/2. Enable this by setting Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE as the lone protocol on an OkHttpClient.Builder . This mode only supports http: URLs and is best suited in closed environments where HTTPS is inappropriate. New: HttpUrl.get(String) is an alternative to HttpUrl.parse(String) that throws an exception when the URL is malformed instead of returning null. Use this to avoid checking for null in situations where the input is known to be well-formed. We ve also added MediaType.get(String) which is an exception-throwing alternative to MediaType.parse(String) . New: The EventListener API previewed in OkHttp 3.9 has graduated to a stable API. Use this interface to track metrics and monitor HTTP requests size and duration. New: okhttp-dnsoverhttps is an experimental API for doing DNS queries over HTTPS. Using HTTPS for DNS offers better security and potentially better performance. This feature is a preview: the API is subject to change. New: okhttp-sse is an early preview of Server-Sent Events (SSE). This feature is incomplete and is only suitable for experimental use. New: MockWebServer now supports client authentication (mutual TLS). Call requestClientAuth() to permit an optional client certificate or requireClientAuth() to require one. New: RecordedRequest.getHandshake() returns the HTTPS handshake of a request sent to MockWebServer . Fix: Honor the MockResponse header delay in MockWebServer. Fix: Don t release HTTP/2 connections that have multiple canceled calls. We had a bug where canceling calls would cause the shared HTTP/2 connection to be unnecessarily released. This harmed connection reuse. Fix: Ensure canceled and discarded HTTP/2 data is not permanently counted against the limited flow control window. We had a few bugs where window size accounting was broken when streams were canceled or reset. Fix: Recover gracefully if the TLS session returns an unexpected version ( NONE ) or cipher suite ( SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ). Fix: Don t change Conscrypt configuration globally. We migrated from a process-wide setting to configuring only OkHttp s TLS sockets. Fix: Prefer TLSv1.2 where it is available. On certain older platforms it is necessary to opt-in to TLSv1.2. New: Request.tag() permits multiple tags. Use a Class ? as a key to identify tags. Note that tag() now returns null if the request has no tag. Previously this would return the request itself. New: Headers.Builder.addAll(Headers) . New: ResponseBody.create(MediaType, ByteString) . New: Embed R8/ProGuard rules in the jar. These will be applied automatically by R8. Fix: Release the connection if Authenticator throws an exception. Fix: Change the declaration of OkHttpClient.cache() to return a @Nullable Cache . The return value has always been nullable but it wasn t declared properly. Fix: Reverse suppression of connect exceptions. When both a call and its retry fail, we now throw the initial exception which is most likely to be actionable. Fix: Retain interrupted state when throwing InterruptedIOException . A single interrupt should now be sufficient to break out an in-flight OkHttp call. Fix: Don t drop a call to EventListener.callEnd() when the response body is consumed inside an interceptor. Version 3.10.0 2018-02-24 The pingInterval() feature now aggressively checks connectivity for web sockets and HTTP/2 connections. Previously if you configured a ping interval that would cause OkHttp to send pings, but it did not track whether the reply pongs were received. With this update OkHttp requires that every ping receive a response: if it does not the connection will be closed and the listener s onFailure() method will be called. Web sockets have always been had pings, but pings on HTTP/2 connections is new in this release. Pings are used for connections that are busy carrying calls and for idle connections in the connection pool. (Pings do not impact when pooled connections are evicted). If you have a configured ping interval, you should confirm that it is long enough for a roundtrip from client to server. If your ping interval is too short, slow connections may be misinterpreted as failed connections. A ping interval of 30 seconds is reasonable for most use cases. OkHttp now supports Conscrypt . Conscrypt is a Java Security Provider that integrates BoringSSL into the Java platform. Conscrypt supports more cipher suites than the JVM\u2019s default provider and may also execute more efficiently. To use it, first register a Conscrypt dependency in your build system. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if you set the okhttp.platform system property to conscrypt . Alternatively, OkHttp will also use Conscrypt if you install it as your preferred security provider. To do so, add the following code to execute before you create your OkHttpClient . Security.insertProviderAt( new org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider(), 1); Conscrypt is the bundled security provider on Android so it is not necessary to configure it on that platform. New: HttpUrl.addQueryParameter() percent-escapes more characters. Previously several ASCII punctuation characters were not percent-escaped when used with this method. This does not impact already-encoded query parameters in APIs like HttpUrl.parse() and HttpUrl.Builder.addEncodedQueryParameter() . New: CBC-mode ECDSA cipher suites have been removed from OkHttp s default configuration: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA . This tracks a Chromium change to remove these cipher suites because they are fragile and rarely-used. New: Don t fall back to common name (CN) verification for hostnames. This behavior was deprecated with RFC 2818 in May 2000 and was recently dropped from major web browsers. New: Honor the Retry-After response header. HTTP 503 (Unavailable) responses are retried automatically if this header is present and its delay is 0 seconds. HTTP 408 (Client Timeout) responses are retried automatically if the header is absent or its delay is 0 seconds. New: Allow request bodies for all HTTP methods except GET and HEAD. New: Automatic module name of okhttp3 for use with the Java Platform Module System. New: Log gzipped bodies when HttpLoggingInterceptor is used as a network interceptor. New: Protocol.QUIC constant. This protocol is not supported but this constant is included for completeness. New: Upgrade to Okio 1.14.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.14.0 /version /dependency com.squareup.okio:okio:1.14.0 Fix: Handle HTTP/1.1 100 Continue status lines, even on requests that did not send the Expect: continue request header. Fix: Do not count web sockets toward the dispatcher s per-host connection limit. Fix: Avoid using invalid HTTPS sessions. This prevents OkHttp from crashing with the error, Unexpected TLS version: NONE . Fix: Don t corrupt the response cache when a 304 (Not Modified) response overrides the stored Content-Encoding header. Fix: Gracefully shut down the HTTP/2 connection before it exhausts the namespace of stream IDs (~536 million streams). Fix: Never pass a null Route to Authenticator . There was a bug where routes were omitted for eagerly-closed connections. Version 3.9.1 2017-11-18 New: Recover gracefully when Android s DNS crashes with an unexpected NullPointerException . New: Recover gracefully when Android s socket connections crash with an unexpected ClassCastException . Fix: Don t include the URL s fragment in encodedQuery() when the query itself is empty. Version 3.9.0 2017-09-03 Interceptors are more capable. The Chain interface now offers access to the call and can adjust all call timeouts. Note that this change is source-incompatible for code that implements the Chain interface. We don t expect this to be a problem in practice! OkHttp has an experimental new API for tracking metrics. The new EventListener API is designed to help developers monitor HTTP requests size and duration. This feature is an unstable preview: the API is subject to change, and the implementation is incomplete. This is a big new API we are eager for feedback. New: Support ALPN via Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider. This expands HTTP/2 support to older Android devices that have Google Play Services. New: Consider all routes when looking for candidate coalesced connections. This increases the likelihood that HTTP/2 connections will be shared. New: Authentication challenges and credentials now use a charset. Use this in your authenticator to support user names and passwords with non-ASCII characters. New: Accept a charset in FormBody.Builder . Previously form bodies were always UTF-8. New: Support the immutable cache-control directive. Fix: Don t crash when an HTTP/2 call is redirected while the connection is being shut down. Fix: Don t drop headers of healthy streams that raced with GOAWAY frames. This bug would cause HTTP/2 streams to occasional hang when the connection was shutting down. Fix: Honor OkHttpClient.retryOnConnectionFailure() when the response is a HTTP 408 Request Timeout. If retries are enabled, OkHttp will retry exactly once in response to a 408. Fix: Don t crash when reading the empty HEAD response body if it specifies a Content-Length . Fix: Don t crash if the thread is interrupted while reading the public suffix database. Fix: Use relative resource path when loading the public suffix database. Loading the resource using a path relative to the class prevents conflicts when the OkHttp classes are relocated (shaded) by allowing multiple private copies of the database. Fix: Accept cookies for URLs that have an IPv6 address for a host. Fix: Don t log the protocol (HTTP/1.1, h2) in HttpLoggingInterceptor if the protocol isn t negotiated yet! Previously we d log HTTP/1.1 by default, and this was confusing. Fix: Omit the message from MockWebServer s HTTP/2 :status header. Fix: Handle Expect: 100 Continue properly in MockWebServer. Version 3.8.1 2017-06-18 Fix: Recover gracefully from stale coalesced connections. We had a bug where connection coalescing (introduced in OkHttp 3.7.0) and stale connection recovery could interact to cause a NoSuchElementException crash in the RouteSelector . Version 3.8.0 2017-05-13 OkHttp now uses @Nullable to annotate all possibly-null values. We ve added a compile-time dependency on the JSR 305 annotations. This is a provided dependency and does not need to be included in your build configuration, .jar file, or .apk . We use @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault and all parameters and return types are never null unless explicitly annotated @Nullable . Warning: this release is source-incompatible for Kotlin users. Nullability was previously ambiguous and lenient but now the compiler will enforce strict null checks. New: The response message is now non-null. This is the Not Found in the status line HTTP 404 Not Found . If you are building responses programmatically (with new Response.Builder() ) you must now always supply a message. An empty string \"\" is permitted. This value was never null on responses returned by OkHttp itself, and it was an old mistake to permit application code to omit a message. The challenge s scheme and realm are now non-null. If you are calling new Challenge(scheme, realm) you must provide non-null values. These were never null in challenges created by OkHttp, but could have been null in application code that creates challenges. New: The TlsVersion of a Handshake is now non-null. If you are calling Handshake.get() with a null TLS version, you must instead now provide a non-null TlsVersion . Cache responses persisted prior to OkHttp 3.0 did not store a TLS version; for these unknown values the handshake is defaulted to TlsVersion.SSL_3_0 . New: Upgrade to Okio 1.13.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.13.0 /version /dependency com.squareup.okio:okio:1.13.0 Fix: gracefully recover when Android 7.0 s sockets throw an unexpected NullPointerException . Version 3.7.0 2017-04-15 OkHttp no longer recovers from TLS handshake failures by attempting a TLSv1 connection. The fallback was necessary for servers that implemented version negotiation incorrectly. Now that 99.99% of servers do it right this fallback is obsolete. Fix: Do not honor cookies set on a public domain. Previously a malicious site could inject cookies on top-level domains like co.uk because our cookie parser didn t honor the public suffix list. Alongside this fix is a new API, HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain() , which returns the privately domain name if the URL has one. Fix: Change MediaType.charset() to return null for unexpected charsets. Fix: Don t skip cache invalidation if the invalidating response has no body. Fix: Don t use a cryptographic random number generator for web sockets. Some Android devices implement SecureRandom incorrectly! Fix: Correctly canonicalize IPv6 addresses in HttpUrl . This prevented OkHttp from trusting HTTPS certificates issued to certain IPv6 addresses. Fix: Don t reuse connections after an unsuccessful Expect: 100-continue . Fix: Handle either TLS_ or SSL_ prefixes for cipher suite names. This is necessary for IBM JVMs that use the SSL_ prefix exclusively. Fix: Reject HTTP/2 data frames if the stream ID is 0. New: Upgrade to Okio 1.12.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.12.0 /version /dependency com.squareup.okio:okio:1.12.0 New: Connection coalescing. OkHttp may reuse HTTP/2 connections across calls that share an IP address and HTTPS certificate, even if their domain names are different. New: MockWebServer s RecordedRequest exposes the requested HttpUrl with getRequestUrl() . Version 3.6.0 2017-01-29 Fix: Don t crash with a cache is closed error when there is an error initializing the cache. Fix: Calling disconnect() on a connecting HttpUrlConnection could cause it to retry in an infinite loop! This regression was introduced in OkHttp 2.7.0. Fix: Drop cookies that contain ASCII NULL and other bad characters. Previously such cookies would cause OkHttp to crash when they were included in a request. Fix: Release duplicated multiplexed connections. If we concurrently establish connections to an HTTP/2 server, close all but the first connection. Fix: Fail the HTTP/2 connection if first frame isn t SETTINGS . Fix: Forbid spaces in header names. Fix: Don t offer to do gzip if the request is partial. Fix: MockWebServer is now usable with JUnit 5. That update broke the rules . New: Support Expect: 100-continue as a request header. Callers can use this header to pessimistically hold off on transmitting a request body until a server gives the go-ahead. New: Permit network interceptors to rewrite the host header for HTTP/2. This makes it possible to do domain fronting. New: charset support for Credentials.basic() . Version 3.5.0 2016-11-30 Web Sockets are now a stable feature of OkHttp. Since being introduced as a beta feature in OkHttp 2.3 our web socket client has matured. Connect to a server s web socket with OkHttpClient.newWebSocket() , send messages with send() , and receive messages with the WebSocketListener . The okhttp-ws submodule is no longer available and okhttp-ws artifacts from previous releases of OkHttp are not compatible with OkHttp 3.5. When upgrading to the new package please note that the WebSocket and WebSocketCall classes have been merged. Sending messages is now asynchronous and they may be enqueued before the web socket is connected. OkHttp no longer attempts a direct connection if the system s HTTP proxy fails. This behavior was surprising because OkHttp was disregarding the user s specified configuration. If you need to customize proxy fallback behavior, implement your own java.net.ProxySelector . Fix: Support TLSv1.3 on devices that support it. Fix: Share pooled connections across equivalent OkHttpClient instances. Previous releases had a bug where a shared connection pool did not guarantee shared connections in some cases. Fix: Prefer the server s response body on all conditional cache misses. Previously we would return the cached response s body if it had a newer Last-Modified date. Fix: Update the stored timestamp on conditional cache hits. New: Optimized HTTP/2 request header encoding. More headers are HPACK-encoded and string literals are now Huffman-encoded. New: Expose Part headers and body in Multipart . New: Make ResponseBody.string() and ResponseBody.charStream() BOM-aware. If your HTTP response body begins with a byte order mark it will be consumed and used to select a charset for the remaining bytes. Most applications should not need a byte order mark. New: Upgrade to Okio 1.11.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.11.0 /version /dependency com.squareup.okio:okio:1.11.0 Fix: Avoid sending empty HTTP/2 data frames when there is no request body. Fix: Add a leading . for better domain matching in JavaNetCookieJar . Fix: Gracefully recover from HTTP/2 connection shutdowns at start of request. Fix: Be lenient if a MediaType s character set is 'single-quoted' . Fix: Allow horizontal tab characters in header values. Fix: When parsing HTTP authentication headers permit challenge parameters in any order. Version 3.4.2 2016-11-03 Fix: Recover gracefully when an HTTP/2 connection is shutdown. We had a bug where shutdown HTTP/2 connections were considered usable. This caused infinite loops when calls attempted to recover. Version 3.4.1 2016-07-10 Fix a major bug in encoding HTTP headers. In 3.4.0 and 3.4.0-RC1 OkHttp had an off-by-one bug in our HPACK encoder. This bug could have caused the wrong headers to be emitted after a sequence of HTTP/2 requests! Everyone who is using OkHttp 3.4.0 or 3.4.0-RC1 should upgrade for this bug fix. Version 3.4.0 2016-07-08 New: Support dynamic table size changes to HPACK Encoder. Fix: Use TreeMap in Headers.toMultimap() . This makes string lookups on the returned map case-insensitive. Fix: Don t share the OkHttpClient s Dispatcher in HttpURLConnection . Version 3.4.0-RC1 2016-07-02 We\u2019ve rewritten HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection. Previously we shared a single HTTP engine between two frontend APIs: HttpURLConnection and Call . With this release we\u2019ve rearranged things so that the HttpURLConnection frontend now delegates to the Call APIs internally. This has enabled substantial simplifications and optimizations in the OkHttp core for both frontends. For most HTTP requests the consequences of this change will be negligible. If your application uses HttpURLConnection.connect() , setFixedLengthStreamingMode() , or setChunkedStreamingMode() , OkHttp will now use a async dispatcher thread to establish the HTTP connection. We don\u2019t expect this change to have any behavior or performance consequences. Regardless, please exercise your OkUrlFactory and HttpURLConnection code when applying this update. Cipher suites may now have arbitrary names. Previously CipherSuite was a Java enum and it was impossible to define new cipher suites without first upgrading OkHttp. With this change it is now a regular Java class with enum-like constants. Application code that uses enum methods on cipher suites ( ordinal() , name() , etc.) will break with this change. Fix: CertificatePinner now matches canonicalized hostnames. Previously this was case sensitive. This change should also make it easier to configure certificate pinning for internationalized domain names. Fix: Don\u2019t crash on non-ASCII ETag headers. Previously OkHttp would reject these headers when validating a cached response. Fix: Don\u2019t allow remote peer to arbitrarily size the HPACK decoder dynamic table. Fix: Honor per-host configuration in Android\u2019s network security config. Previously disabling cleartext for any host would disable cleartext for all hosts. Note that this setting is only available on Android 24+. New: HPACK compression is now dynamic. This should improve performance when transmitting request headers over HTTP/2. New: Dispatcher.setIdleCallback() can be used to signal when there are no calls in flight. This is useful for testing with Espresso . New: Upgrade to Okio 1.9.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.9.0 /version /dependency Version 3.3.1 2016-05-28 Fix: The plaintext check in HttpLoggingInterceptor incorrectly classified newline characters as control characters. This is fixed. Fix: Don t crash reading non-ASCII characters in HTTP/2 headers or in cached HTTP headers. Fix: Retain the response body when an attempt to open a web socket returns a non-101 response code. Version 3.3.0 2016-05-24 New: Response.sentRequestAtMillis() and receivedResponseAtMillis() methods track the system s local time when network calls are made. These replace the OkHttp-Sent-Millis and OkHttp-Received-Millis headers that were present in earlier versions of OkHttp. New: Accept user-provided trust managers in OkHttpClient.Builder . This allows OkHttp to satisfy its TLS requirements directly. Otherwise OkHttp will use reflection to extract the TrustManager from the SSLSocketFactory . New: Support prerelease Java 9. This gets ALPN from the platform rather than relying on the alpn-boot bootclasspath override. New: HttpLoggingInterceptor now logs connection failures. New: Upgrade to Okio 1.8.0. dependency groupId com.squareup.okio /groupId artifactId okio /artifactId version 1.8.0 /version /dependency Fix: Gracefully recover from a failure to rebuild the cache journal. Fix: Don t corrupt cache entries when a cache entry is evicted while it is being updated. Fix: Make logging more consistent throughout OkHttp. Fix: Log plaintext bodies only. This uses simple heuristics to differentiate text from other data. Fix: Recover from REFUSED_STREAM errors in HTTP/2. This should improve interoperability with Nginx 1.10.0, which refuses streams created before HTTP/2 settings have been acknowledged. Fix: Improve recovery from failed routes. Fix: Accommodate tunneling proxies that close the connection after an auth challenge. Fix: Use the proxy authenticator when authenticating HTTP proxies. This regression was introduced in OkHttp 3.0. Fix: Fail fast if network interceptors transform the response body such that closing it doesn t also close the underlying stream. We had a bug where OkHttp would attempt to reuse a connection but couldn t because it was still held by a prior request. Fix: Ensure network interceptors always have access to the underlying connection. Fix: Use X509TrustManagerExtensions on Android 17+. Fix: Unblock waiting dispatchers on MockWebServer shutdown. Version 3.2.0 2016-02-25 Fix: Change the certificate pinner to always build full chains. This prevents a potential crash when using certificate pinning with the Google Play Services security provider. Fix: Make IPv6 request lines consistent with Firefox and Chrome. Fix: Recover gracefully when trimming the response cache fails. New: Add multiple path segments using a single string in HttpUrl.Builder . New: Support SHA-256 pins in certificate pinner. Version 3.1.2 2016-02-10 Fix: Don\u2019t crash when finding the trust manager on Robolectric. We attempted to detect the host platform and got confused because Robolectric looks like Android but isn\u2019t! Fix: Change CertificatePinner to skip sanitizing the certificate chain when no certificates were pinned. This avoids an SSL failure in insecure \u201ctrust everyone\u201d configurations, such as when talking to a development HTTPS server that has a self-signed certificate. Version 3.1.1 2016-02-07 Fix: Don t crash when finding the trust manager if the Play Services (GMS) security provider is installed. Fix: The previous release introduced a performance regression on Android, caused by looking up CA certificates. This is now fixed. Version 3.1.0 2016-02-06 New: WebSockets now defer some writes. This should improve performance for some applications. New: Override equals() and hashCode() in our new cookie class. This class now defines equality by value rather than by reference. New: Handle 408 responses by retrying the request. This allows servers to direct clients to retry rather than failing permanently. New: Expose the framed protocol in Connection . Previously this would return the application-layer protocol (HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0); now it always returns the wire-layer protocol (HTTP/2, SPDY/3.1, or HTTP/1.1). Fix: Permit the trusted CA root to be pinned by CertificatePinner . Fix: Silently ignore unknown HTTP/2 settings. Previously this would cause the entire connection to fail. Fix: Don\u2019t crash on unexpected charsets in the logging interceptor. Fix: OkHttpClient is now non-final for the benefit of mocking frameworks. Mocking sophisticated classes like OkHttpClient is fragile and you shouldn\u2019t do it. But if that\u2019s how you want to live your life we won\u2019t stand in your way! Version 3.0.1 2016-01-14 Rollback OSGi support. This was causing library jars to include more classes than expected, which interfered with Gradle builds. Version 3.0.0 2016-01-13 This release commits to a stable 3.0 API. Read the 3.0.0-RC1 changes for advice on upgrading from 2.x to 3.x. The Callback interface now takes a Call . This makes it easier to check if the call was canceled from within the callback. When migrating async calls to this new API, Call is now the first parameter for both onResponse() and onFailure() . Fix: handle multiple cookies in JavaNetCookieJar on Android. Fix: improve the default HTTP message in MockWebServer responses. Fix: don t leak file handles when a conditional GET throws. Fix: Use charset specified by the request body content type in OkHttp s logging interceptor. Fix: Don t eagerly release pools on cache hits. New: Make OkHttp OSGi ready. New: Add already-implemented interfaces Closeable and Flushable to the cache. Version 3.0.0-RC1 2016-01-02 OkHttp 3 is a major release focused on API simplicity and consistency. The API changes are numerous but most are cosmetic. Applications should be able to upgrade from the 2.x API to the 3.x API mechanically and without risk. Because the release includes breaking API changes, we re changing the project s package name from com.squareup.okhttp to okhttp3 . This should make it possible for large applications to migrate incrementally. The Maven group ID is now com.squareup.okhttp3 . For an explanation of this strategy, see Jake Wharton s post, Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates . This release obsoletes OkHttp 2.x, and all code that uses OkHttp s com.squareup.okhttp package should upgrade to the okhttp3 package. Libraries that depend on OkHttp should upgrade quickly to prevent applications from being stuck on the old version. There is no longer a global singleton connection pool. In OkHttp 2.x, all OkHttpClient instances shared a common connection pool by default. In OkHttp 3.x, each new OkHttpClient gets its own private connection pool. Applications should avoid creating many connection pools as doing so prevents connection reuse. Each connection pool holds its own set of connections alive so applications that have many pools also risk exhausting memory! The best practice in OkHttp 3 is to create a single OkHttpClient instance and share it throughout the application. Requests that needs a customized client should call OkHttpClient.newBuilder() on that shared instance. This allows customization without the drawbacks of separate connection pools. OkHttpClient is now stateless. In the 2.x API OkHttpClient had getters and setters. Internally each request was forced to make its own complete snapshot of the OkHttpClient instance to defend against racy configuration changes. In 3.x, OkHttpClient is now stateless and has a builder. Note that this class is not strictly immutable as it has stateful members like the connection pool and cache. Get and Set prefixes are now avoided. With ubiquitous builders throughout OkHttp these accessor prefixes aren t necessary. Previously OkHttp used get and set prefixes sporadically which make the API inconsistent and awkward to explore. OkHttpClient now implements the new Call.Factory interface. This interface will make your code easier to test. When you test code that makes HTTP requests, you can use this interface to replace the real OkHttpClient with your own mocks or fakes. The interface will also let you use OkHttp s API with another HTTP client s implementation. This is useful in sandboxed environments like Google App Engine. OkHttp now does cookies. We ve replaced java.net.CookieHandler with a new interface, CookieJar and added our own Cookie model class. This new cookie follows the latest RFC and supports the same cookie attributes as modern web browsers. Form and Multipart bodies are now modeled. We ve replaced the opaque FormEncodingBuilder with the more powerful FormBody and FormBody.Builder combo. Similarly we ve upgraded MultipartBuilder into MultipartBody , MultipartBody.Part , and MultipartBody.Builder . The Apache HTTP client and HttpURLConnection APIs are deprecated. They continue to work as they always have, but we re moving everything to the new OkHttp 3 API. The okhttp-apache and okhttp-urlconnection modules should be only be used to accelerate a transition to OkHttp s request/response API. These deprecated modules will be dropped in an upcoming OkHttp 3.x release. Canceling batches of calls is now the application s responsibility. The API to cancel calls by tag has been removed and replaced with a more general mechanism. The dispatcher now exposes all in-flight calls via its runningCalls() and queuedCalls() methods. You can write code that selects calls by tag, host, or whatever, and invokes Call.cancel() on the ones that are no longer necessary. OkHttp no longer uses the global java.net.Authenticator by default. We ve changed our Authenticator interface to authenticate web and proxy authentication failures through a single method. An adapter for the old authenticator is available in the okhttp-urlconnection module. Fix: Don t throw IOException on ResponseBody.contentLength() or close() . Fix: Never throw converting an HttpUrl to a java.net.URI . This changes the uri() method to handle malformed percent-escapes and characters forbidden by URI . Fix: When a connect times out, attempt an alternate route. Previously route selection was less efficient when differentiating failures. New: Response.peekBody() lets you access the response body without consuming it. This may be handy for interceptors! New: HttpUrl.newBuilder() resolves a link to a builder. New: Add the TLS version to the Handshake . New: Drop Request.uri() and Request#urlString() . Just use Request.url().uri() and Request.url().toString() . New: Add URL to HTTP response logging. New: Make HttpUrl the blessed URL method of Request .

These facades hide OkHttp s implementation behind another client s API. If you still need this please copy and paste ObsoleteUrlFactory.java or ObsoleteApacheClient.java into your project. OkHttp now supports duplex calls over HTTP/2. With normal HTTP calls the request must finish before the response starts. With duplex, request and response bodies are transmitted simultaneously. This can be used to implement interactive conversations within a single HTTP call. Create duplex calls by overriding the new RequestBody.isDuplex() method to return true. This simple option dramatically changes the behavior of the request body and of the entire call. The RequestBody.writeTo() method may now retain a reference to the provided sink and hand it off to another thread to write to it after writeTo returns. The EventListener may now see requests and responses interleaved in ways not previously permitted. For example, a listener may receive responseHeadersStart() followed by requestBodyEnd() , both on the same call. Such events may be triggered by different threads even for a single call. Interceptors that rewrite or replace the request body may now inadvertently interfere with duplex request bodies. Such interceptors should check RequestBody.isDuplex() and avoid accessing the request body when it is. Duplex calls require HTTP/2. If HTTP/1 is established instead the duplex call will fail. The most common use of duplex calls is gRPC . New: Prevent OkHttp from retransmitting a request body by overriding RequestBody.isOneShot() . This is most useful when writing the request body is destructive. New: We ve added requestFailed() and responseFailed() methods to EventListener . These are called instead of requestBodyEnd() and responseBodyEnd() in some failure situations. They may also be fired in cases where no event was published previously. In this release we did an internal rewrite of our event code to fix problems where events were lost or unbalanced. Fix: Don t leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the onFailure() callback. Fix: Apply call timeouts when connecting duplex calls, web sockets, and server-sent events. Once the streams are established no further timeout is enforced. Fix: Retain the Route when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was causing some Authenticator calls to see a null route when non-null was expected. Fix: Use the correct key size in the name of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 which is a TLS 1.3 cipher suite. We accidentally specified a key size of 256, preventing that cipher suite from being selected for any TLS handshakes. We didn t notice because this cipher suite isn t supported on Android, Java, or Conscrypt. We removed this cipher suite and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 from the restricted, modern, and compatible sets of cipher suites. These two cipher suites aren t enabled by default in either Firefox or Chrome. See our TLS Configuration History tracker for a log of all changes to OkHttp s default TLS options.

But because upgrading is difficult we will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2021. (This commitment was originally through December 31, 2020; we have since extended it.) TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are no longer enabled by default. Major web browsers are working towards removing these versions altogether in early 2020.

This requires either Conscrypt or Java 11+. Proxy authenticators are now asked for preemptive authentication. OkHttp will now request authentication credentials before creating TLS tunnels through HTTP proxies (HTTP CONNECT ). Authenticators should identify preemptive authentications by the presence of a challenge whose scheme is OkHttp-Preemptive . OkHttp now offers full-operation timeouts. This sets a limit on how long the entire call may take and covers resolving DNS, connecting, writing the request body, server processing, and reading the full response body. If a call requires redirects or retries all must complete within one timeout period. Use OkHttpClient.Builder.callTimeout() to specify the default duration and Call.timeout() to specify the timeout of an individual call.

HeldCertificate is a TLS certificate and its private key. Generate a certificate with its builder then use it to sign another certificate or perform a TLS handshake. The certificatePem() method encodes the certificate in the familiar PEM format ( --- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- ); the privateKeyPkcs8Pem() does likewise for the private key. HandshakeCertificates holds the TLS certificates required for a TLS handshake. On the server it keeps your HeldCertificate and its chain. On the client it keeps the root certificates that are trusted to sign a server s certificate chain. HandshakeCertificates also works with mutual TLS where these roles are reversed. These classes make it possible to enable HTTPS in MockWebServer in just a few lines of code . OkHttp now supports prior knowledge cleartext HTTP/2. Enable this by setting Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE as the lone protocol on an OkHttpClient.Builder . This mode only supports http: URLs and is best suited in closed environments where HTTPS is inappropriate. New: HttpUrl.get(String) is an alternative to HttpUrl.parse(String) that throws an exception when the URL is malformed instead of returning null. Use this to avoid checking for null in situations where the input is known to be well-formed. We ve also added MediaType.get(String) which is an exception-throwing alternative to MediaType.parse(String) . New: The EventListener API previewed in OkHttp 3.9 has graduated to a stable API. Use this interface to track metrics and monitor HTTP requests size and duration. New: okhttp-dnsoverhttps is an experimental API for doing DNS queries over HTTPS. Using HTTPS for DNS offers better security and potentially better performance. This feature is a preview: the API is subject to change. New: okhttp-sse is an early preview of Server-Sent Events (SSE). This feature is incomplete and is only suitable for experimental use. New: MockWebServer now supports client authentication (mutual TLS). Call requestClientAuth() to permit an optional client certificate or requireClientAuth() to require one. New: RecordedRequest.getHandshake() returns the HTTPS handshake of a request sent to MockWebServer . Fix: Honor the MockResponse header delay in MockWebServer. Fix: Don t release HTTP/2 connections that have multiple canceled calls. We had a bug where canceling calls would cause the shared HTTP/2 connection to be unnecessarily released. This harmed connection reuse. Fix: Ensure canceled and discarded HTTP/2 data is not permanently counted against the limited flow control window. We had a few bugs where window size accounting was broken when streams were canceled or reset. Fix: Recover gracefully if the TLS session returns an unexpected version ( NONE ) or cipher suite ( SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ). Fix: Don t change Conscrypt configuration globally. We migrated from a process-wide setting to configuring only OkHttp s TLS sockets. Fix: Prefer TLSv1.2 where it is available. On certain older platforms it is necessary to opt-in to TLSv1.2. New: Request.tag() permits multiple tags. Use a Class ? as a key to identify tags. Note that tag() now returns null if the request has no tag. Previously this would return the request itself. New: Headers.Builder.addAll(Headers) . New: ResponseBody.create(MediaType, ByteString) . New: Embed R8/ProGuard rules in the jar. These will be applied automatically by R8. Fix: Release the connection if Authenticator throws an exception. Fix: Change the declaration of OkHttpClient.cache() to return a @Nullable Cache . The return value has always been nullable but it wasn t declared properly. Fix: Reverse suppression of connect exceptions. When both a call and its retry fail, we now throw the initial exception which is most likely to be actionable. Fix: Retain interrupted state when throwing InterruptedIOException .

Previously if you configured a ping interval that would cause OkHttp to send pings, but it did not track whether the reply pongs were received. With this update OkHttp requires that every ping receive a response: if it does not the connection will be closed and the listener s onFailure() method will be called. Web sockets have always been had pings, but pings on HTTP/2 connections is new in this release. Pings are used for connections that are busy carrying calls and for idle connections in the connection pool. (Pings do not impact when pooled connections are evicted). If you have a configured ping interval, you should confirm that it is long enough for a roundtrip from client to server. If your ping interval is too short, slow connections may be misinterpreted as failed connections. A ping interval of 30 seconds is reasonable for most use cases. OkHttp now supports Conscrypt . Conscrypt is a Java Security Provider that integrates BoringSSL into the Java platform. Conscrypt supports more cipher suites than the JVM\u2019s default provider and may also execute more efficiently. To use it, first register a Conscrypt dependency in your build system. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if you set the okhttp.platform system property to conscrypt . Alternatively, OkHttp will also use Conscrypt if you install it as your preferred security provider. To do so, add the following code to execute before you create your OkHttpClient . Security.insertProviderAt( new org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider(), 1); Conscrypt is the bundled security provider on Android so it is not necessary to configure it on that platform. New: HttpUrl.addQueryParameter() percent-escapes more characters. Previously several ASCII punctuation characters were not percent-escaped when used with this method. This does not impact already-encoded query parameters in APIs like HttpUrl.parse() and HttpUrl.Builder.addEncodedQueryParameter() . New: CBC-mode ECDSA cipher suites have been removed from OkHttp s default configuration: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA . This tracks a Chromium change to remove these cipher suites because they are fragile and rarely-used. New: Don t fall back to common name (CN) verification for hostnames. This behavior was deprecated with RFC 2818 in May 2000 and was recently dropped from major web browsers. New: Honor the Retry-After response header. HTTP 503 (Unavailable) responses are retried automatically if this header is present and its delay is 0 seconds. HTTP 408 (Client Timeout) responses are retried automatically if the header is absent or its delay is 0 seconds. New: Allow request bodies for all HTTP methods except GET and HEAD. New: Automatic module name of okhttp3 for use with the Java Platform Module System. New: Log gzipped bodies when HttpLoggingInterceptor is used as a network interceptor. New: Protocol.QUIC constant.

The new EventListener API is designed to help developers monitor HTTP requests size and duration. This feature is an unstable preview: the API is subject to change, and the implementation is incomplete. This is a big new API we are eager for feedback. New: Support ALPN via Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider. This expands HTTP/2 support to older Android devices that have Google Play Services. New: Consider all routes when looking for candidate coalesced connections. This increases the likelihood that HTTP/2 connections will be shared. New: Authentication challenges and credentials now use a charset. Use this in your authenticator to support user names and passwords with non-ASCII characters. New: Accept a charset in FormBody.Builder . Previously form bodies were always UTF-8. New: Support the immutable cache-control directive. Fix: Don t crash when an HTTP/2 call is redirected while the connection is being shut down. Fix: Don t drop headers of healthy streams that raced with GOAWAY frames. This bug would cause HTTP/2 streams to occasional hang when the connection was shutting down. Fix: Honor OkHttpClient.retryOnConnectionFailure() when the response is a HTTP 408 Request Timeout. If retries are enabled, OkHttp will retry exactly once in response to a 408. Fix: Don t crash when reading the empty HEAD response body if it specifies a Content-Length . Fix: Don t crash if the thread is interrupted while reading the public suffix database. Fix: Use relative resource path when loading the public suffix database. Loading the resource using a path relative to the class prevents conflicts when the OkHttp classes are relocated (shaded) by allowing multiple private copies of the database. Fix: Accept cookies for URLs that have an IPv6 address for a host. Fix: Don t log the protocol (HTTP/1.1, h2) in HttpLoggingInterceptor if the protocol isn t negotiated yet! Previously we d log HTTP/1.1 by default, and this was confusing. Fix: Omit the message from MockWebServer s HTTP/2 :status header.

We ve added a compile-time dependency on the JSR 305 annotations. This is a provided dependency and does not need to be included in your build configuration, .jar file, or .apk . We use @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault and all parameters and return types are never null unless explicitly annotated @Nullable . Warning: this release is source-incompatible for Kotlin users. Nullability was previously ambiguous and lenient but now the compiler will enforce strict null checks. New: The response message is now non-null. This is the Not Found in the status line HTTP 404 Not Found . If you are building responses programmatically (with new Response.Builder() ) you must now always supply a message. An empty string \"\" is permitted. This value was never null on responses returned by OkHttp itself, and it was an old mistake to permit application code to omit a message. The challenge s scheme and realm are now non-null. If you are calling new Challenge(scheme, realm) you must provide non-null values. These were never null in challenges created by OkHttp, but could have been null in application code that creates challenges. New: The TlsVersion of a Handshake is now non-null. If you are calling Handshake.get() with a null TLS version, you must instead now provide a non-null TlsVersion . Cache responses persisted prior to OkHttp 3.0 did not store a TLS version; for these unknown values the handshake is defaulted to TlsVersion.SSL_3_0 .

Alongside this fix is a new API, HttpUrl.topPrivateDomain() , which returns the privately domain name if the URL has one. Fix: Change MediaType.charset() to return null for unexpected charsets. Fix: Don t skip cache invalidation if the invalidating response has no body. Fix: Don t use a cryptographic random number generator for web sockets. Some Android devices implement SecureRandom incorrectly! Fix: Correctly canonicalize IPv6 addresses in HttpUrl . This prevented OkHttp from trusting HTTPS certificates issued to certain IPv6 addresses. Fix: Don t reuse connections after an unsuccessful Expect: 100-continue .

Since being introduced as a beta feature in OkHttp 2.3 our web socket client has matured. Connect to a server s web socket with OkHttpClient.newWebSocket() , send messages with send() , and receive messages with the WebSocketListener . The okhttp-ws submodule is no longer available and okhttp-ws artifacts from previous releases of OkHttp are not compatible with OkHttp 3.5. When upgrading to the new package please note that the WebSocket and WebSocketCall classes have been merged. Sending messages is now asynchronous and they may be enqueued before the web socket is connected. OkHttp no longer attempts a direct connection if the system s HTTP proxy fails. This behavior was surprising because OkHttp was disregarding the user s specified configuration. If you need to customize proxy fallback behavior, implement your own java.net.ProxySelector . Fix: Support TLSv1.3 on devices that support it. Fix: Share pooled connections across equivalent OkHttpClient instances. Previous releases had a bug where a shared connection pool did not guarantee shared connections in some cases. Fix: Prefer the server s response body on all conditional cache misses. Previously we would return the cached response s body if it had a newer Last-Modified date. Fix: Update the stored timestamp on conditional cache hits. New: Optimized HTTP/2 request header encoding. More headers are HPACK-encoded and string literals are now Huffman-encoded. New: Expose Part headers and body in Multipart . New: Make ResponseBody.string() and ResponseBody.charStream() BOM-aware.

Previously we shared a single HTTP engine between two frontend APIs: HttpURLConnection and Call . With this release we\u2019ve rearranged things so that the HttpURLConnection frontend now delegates to the Call APIs internally. This has enabled substantial simplifications and optimizations in the OkHttp core for both frontends. For most HTTP requests the consequences of this change will be negligible. If your application uses HttpURLConnection.connect() , setFixedLengthStreamingMode() , or setChunkedStreamingMode() , OkHttp will now use a async dispatcher thread to establish the HTTP connection. We don\u2019t expect this change to have any behavior or performance consequences. Regardless, please exercise your OkUrlFactory and HttpURLConnection code when applying this update. Cipher suites may now have arbitrary names. Previously CipherSuite was a Java enum and it was impossible to define new cipher suites without first upgrading OkHttp. With this change it is now a regular Java class with enum-like constants. Application code that uses enum methods on cipher suites ( ordinal() , name() , etc.) will break with this change. Fix: CertificatePinner now matches canonicalized hostnames. Previously this was case sensitive. This change should also make it easier to configure certificate pinning for internationalized domain names. Fix: Don\u2019t crash on non-ASCII ETag headers.

The API changes are numerous but most are cosmetic. Applications should be able to upgrade from the 2.x API to the 3.x API mechanically and without risk. Because the release includes breaking API changes, we re changing the project s package name from com.squareup.okhttp to okhttp3 . This should make it possible for large applications to migrate incrementally. The Maven group ID is now com.squareup.okhttp3 . For an explanation of this strategy, see Jake Wharton s post, Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates . This release obsoletes OkHttp 2.x, and all code that uses OkHttp s com.squareup.okhttp package should upgrade to the okhttp3 package. Libraries that depend on OkHttp should upgrade quickly to prevent applications from being stuck on the old version. There is no longer a global singleton connection pool. In OkHttp 2.x, all OkHttpClient instances shared a common connection pool by default. In OkHttp 3.x, each new OkHttpClient gets its own private connection pool. Applications should avoid creating many connection pools as doing so prevents connection reuse. Each connection pool holds its own set of connections alive so applications that have many pools also risk exhausting memory! The best practice in OkHttp 3 is to create a single OkHttpClient instance and share it throughout the application. Requests that needs a customized client should call OkHttpClient.newBuilder() on that shared instance. This allows customization without the drawbacks of separate connection pools. OkHttpClient is now stateless. In the 2.x API OkHttpClient had getters and setters. Internally each request was forced to make its own complete snapshot of the OkHttpClient instance to defend against racy configuration changes. In 3.x, OkHttpClient is now stateless and has a builder. Note that this class is not strictly immutable as it has stateful members like the connection pool and cache. Get and Set prefixes are now avoided. With ubiquitous builders throughout OkHttp these accessor prefixes aren t necessary. Previously OkHttp used get and set prefixes sporadically which make the API inconsistent and awkward to explore. OkHttpClient now implements the new Call.Factory interface. This interface will make your code easier to test. When you test code that makes HTTP requests, you can use this interface to replace the real OkHttpClient with your own mocks or fakes. The interface will also let you use OkHttp s API with another HTTP client s implementation. This is useful in sandboxed environments like Google App Engine. OkHttp now does cookies. We ve replaced java.net.CookieHandler with a new interface, CookieJar and added our own Cookie model class. This new cookie follows the latest RFC and supports the same cookie attributes as modern web browsers. Form and Multipart bodies are now modeled. We ve replaced the opaque FormEncodingBuilder with the more powerful FormBody and FormBody.Builder combo. Similarly we ve upgraded MultipartBuilder into MultipartBody , MultipartBody.Part , and MultipartBody.Builder . The Apache HTTP client and HttpURLConnection APIs are deprecated. They continue to work as they always have, but we re moving everything to the new OkHttp 3 API. The okhttp-apache and okhttp-urlconnection modules should be only be used to accelerate a transition to OkHttp s request/response API. These deprecated modules will be dropped in an upcoming OkHttp 3.x release. Canceling batches of calls is now the application s responsibility. The API to cancel calls by tag has been removed and replaced with a more general mechanism. The dispatcher now exposes all in-flight calls via its runningCalls() and queuedCalls() methods. You can write code that selects calls by tag, host, or whatever, and invokes Call.cancel() on the ones that are no longer necessary. OkHttp no longer uses the global java.net.Authenticator by default. We ve changed our Authenticator interface to authenticate web and proxy authentication failures through a single method. An adapter for the old authenticator is available in the okhttp-urlconnection module. Fix: Don t throw IOException on ResponseBody.contentLength() or close() . Fix: Never throw converting an HttpUrl to a java.net.URI . This changes the uri() method to handle malformed percent-escapes and characters forbidden by URI . Fix: When a connect times out, attempt an alternate route. Previously route selection was less efficient when differentiating failures. New: Response.peekBody() lets you access the response body without consuming it. This may be handy for interceptors! New: HttpUrl.newBuilder() resolves a link to a builder. New: Add the TLS version to the Handshake . New: Drop Request.uri() and Request#urlString() . Just use Request.url().uri() and Request.url().toString() . New: Add URL to HTTP response logging.

HTTP/2 Connections The HttpURLConnection API is a blocking API. You make a blocking write to send a request, and a blocking read to receive the response. Blocking APIs Blocking APIs are convenient because you get top-to-bottom procedural code without indirection. Network calls work like regular method calls: ask for data and it is returned. If the request fails, you get a stacktrace right were the call was made. Blocking APIs may be inefficient because you hold a thread idle while waiting on the network. Threads are expensive because they have both a memory overhead and a context-switching overhead. Framed protocols Framed protocols like http/2 don t lend themselves to blocking APIs. Each application-layer thread wants to do blocking I/O for a specific stream, but the streams are multiplexed on the socket. You can t just talk to the socket, you need to cooperate with the other application-layer threads that you re sharing it with. Framing rules make it impractical to implement http/2 correctly on a single blocking thread. The flow-control features introduce feedback between reads and writes, requiring writes to acknowledge reads and reads to throttle writes. In OkHttp we expose a blocking API over a framed protocol. This document explains the code and policy that makes that work. Threads Application s calling thread The application-layer must block on writing I/O. We can t return from a write until we ve pushed its bytes onto the socket. Otherwise, if the write fails we are unable to deliver its IOException to the application. We would have told the application layer that the write succeeded, but it didn t! The application-layer can also do blocking reads. If the application asks to read and there s nothing available, we need to hold that thread until either the bytes arrive, the stream is closed, or a timeout elapses. If we get bytes but there s nobody asking for them, we buffer them. We don t consider bytes as delivered for flow control until they re consumed by the application. Consider an application streaming a video over http/2. Perhaps the user pauses the video and the application stops reading bytes from this stream. The buffer will fill up, and flow control prevents the server from sending more data on this stream. When the user unpauses her video the buffer drains, the read is acknowledged, and the server proceeds to stream data. Shared reader thread We can t rely on application threads to read data from the socket. Application threads are transient: sometimes they re reading and writing and sometimes they re off doing application-layer things. But the socket is permanent, and it needs constant attention: we dispatch all incoming frames so the connection is good-to-go when the application layer needs it. So we have a dedicated thread for every socket that just reads frames and dispatches them. The reader thread must never run application-layer code. Otherwise one slow stream can hold up the entire connection. Similarly, the reader thread must never block on writing because this can deadlock the connection. Consider a client and server that both violate this rule. If you get unlucky, they could fill up their TCP buffers (so that writes block) and then use their reader threads to write a frame. Nobody is reading on either end, and the buffers are never drained. Do-stuff-later pool Sometimes there s an action required like calling the application layer or responding to a ping, and the thread discovering the action is not the thread that should do the work. We enqueue a runnable on this executor and it gets handled by one of the executor s threads. Locks We have 3 different things that we synchronize on. Http2Connection This lock guards internal state of each connection. This lock is never held for blocking operations. That means that we acquire the lock, read or write a few fields and release the lock. No I/O and no application-layer callbacks. Http2Stream This lock guards the internal state of each stream. As above, it is never held for blocking operations. When we need to hold an application thread to block a read, we use wait/notify on this lock. This works because the lock is released while wait() is waiting. Http2Writer Socket writes are guarded by the Http2Writer. Only one stream can write at a time so that messages are not interleaved. Writes are either made by application-layer threads or the do-stuff-later pool. Holding multiple locks You re allowed to take the Http2Connection lock while holding the Http2Writer lock. But not vice-versa. Because taking the Http2Writer lock can block. This is necessary for bookkeeping when creating new streams. Correct framing requires that stream IDs are sequential on the socket, so we need to bundle assigning the ID with sending the SYN_STREAM frame. Connection Pool A primary responsibility for any HTTP client is to efficiently manage network connections. Creating and establishing new connections require a fair amount of overhead and added latency. OkHttp will make every effort to reuse existing connections to avoid this overhead and added latency. Every OkHttpClient uses a connection pool. Its job is to maintain a reference to all open connections. When an HTTP request is started, OkHttp will attempt to reuse an existing connection from the pool. If there are no existing connections, a new one is created and put into the connection pool. For HTTP/2, the connection can be reused immediately. For HTTP/1, the request must be completed before it can be reused. Since HTTP requests frequently happen in parallel, connection pooling must be thread-safe. These are the primary classes involved with establishing, sharing, and terminating connections: RealConnectionPool manages reuse of HTTP and HTTP/2 connections for reduced latency. Every OkHttpClient has one, and its lifetime spans the lifetime of the OkHttpClient. RealConnection is the socket and streams of an HTTP/1 or HTTP/2 connection. These are created on demand to fulfill HTTP requests. They may be reused for many HTTP request/response exchanges. Their lifetime is typically shorter than a connection pool. Exchange carries a single HTTP request/response pair. ExchangeFinder chooses which connection carries each exchange. Where possible it will use the same connection for all exchanges in a single call. It prefers reusing pooled connections over establishing new connections. Per-Connection Locks Each connection has its own lock. The connections in the pool are all in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue . Due to data races, iterators of this queue may return removed connections. Callers must check the connection s noNewExchanges property before using connections from the pool. The connection lock is never held while doing I/O (even closing a socket) to prevent contention. A lock-per-connection is used to maximize concurrency.","title":"Concurrency"},{"location":"concurrency/#concurrency","text":"This document describes the concurrency considerations for http/2 connections and the connection pool within OkHttp.","title":"Concurrency"},{"location":"concurrency/#http2-connections","text":"The HttpURLConnection API is a blocking API.

Builder () . url ( https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . build (); System . out . println ( REQUEST 1 (new connection) ); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { // Consume and discard the response body. response . body (). source (). readByteString (); } System . out . println ( REQUEST 2 (pooled connection) ); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { // Consume and discard the response body. response . body (). source (). readByteString (); } And the listener prints the corresponding events: REQUEST 1 (new connection) 0.000 callStart 0.010 dnsStart 0.017 dnsEnd 0.025 connectStart 0.117 secureConnectStart 0.586 secureConnectEnd 0.586 connectEnd 0.587 connectionAcquired 0.588 requestHeadersStart 0.590 requestHeadersEnd 0.591 responseHeadersStart 0.675 responseHeadersEnd 0.676 responseBodyStart 0.679 responseBodyEnd 0.679 connectionReleased 0.680 callEnd REQUEST 2 (pooled connection) 0.000 callStart 0.001 connectionAcquired 0.001 requestHeadersStart 0.001 requestHeadersEnd 0.002 responseHeadersStart 0.082 responseHeadersEnd 0.082 responseBodyStart 0.082 responseBodyEnd 0.083 connectionReleased 0.083 callEnd Notice how no connect events are fired for the second call. It reused the connection from the first request for dramatically better performance. EventListener.Factory In the preceding example we used a field, callStartNanos , to track the elapsed time of each event. This is handy, but it won\u2019t work if multiple calls are executing concurrently. To accommodate this, use a Factory to create a new EventListener instance for each Call . This allows each listener to keep call-specific state. This sample factory creates a unique ID for each call and uses that ID to differentiate calls in log messages. class PrintingEventListener extends EventListener { public static final Factory FACTORY = new Factory () { final AtomicLong nextCallId = new AtomicLong ( 1L ); @Override public EventListener create ( Call call ) { long callId = nextCallId . getAndIncrement (); System . out . printf ( %04d %s%n , callId , call . request (). url ()); return new PrintingEventListener ( callId , System . nanoTime ()); } }; final long callId ; final long callStartNanos ; public PrintingEventListener ( long callId , long callStartNanos ) { this . callId = callId ; this . callStartNanos = callStartNanos ; } private void printEvent ( String name ) { long elapsedNanos = System . nanoTime () - callStartNanos ; System . out . printf ( %04d %.3f %s%n , callId , elapsedNanos / 1000000000 d , name ); } @Override public void callStart ( Call call ) { printEvent ( callStart ); } @Override public void callEnd ( Call call ) { printEvent ( callEnd ); } ... } We can use this listener to race a pair of concurrent HTTP requests: Request washingtonPostRequest = new Request .

NONE ; } } }; ... } Events with Failures When an operation fails, a failure method is called. This is connectFailed() for failures while building a connection to the server, and callFailed() when the HTTP call fails permanently. When a failure happens it is possible that a start event won\u2019t have a corresponding end event. Events with Retries and Follow-Ups OkHttp is resilient and can automatically recover from some connectivity failures. In this case, the connectFailed() event is not terminal and not followed by callFailed() . Event listeners will receive multiple events of the same type when retries are attempted. A single HTTP call may require follow-up requests to be made to handle authentication challenges, redirects, and HTTP-layer timeouts. In such cases multiple connections, requests, and responses may be attempted. Follow-ups are another reason a single call may trigger multiple events of the same type.

This simple-looking method is where all the HTTP work happens, producing a response to satisfy the request. If chain.proceed(request) is being called more than once previous response bodies must be closed. Interceptors can be chained. Suppose you have both a compressing interceptor and a checksumming interceptor: you ll need to decide whether data is compressed and then checksummed, or checksummed and then compressed. OkHttp uses lists to track interceptors, and interceptors are called in order. Application Interceptors Interceptors are registered as either application or network interceptors. We ll use the LoggingInterceptor defined above to show the difference. Register an application interceptor by calling addInterceptor() on OkHttpClient.Builder : OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient . Builder () . addInterceptor ( new LoggingInterceptor ()) . build (); Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . header ( User-Agent , OkHttp Example ) . build (); Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute (); response . body (). close (); The URL http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt redirects to https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt , and OkHttp follows this redirect automatically. Our application interceptor is called once and the response returned from chain.proceed() has the redirected response: INFO: Sending request http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt on null User-Agent: OkHttp Example INFO: Received response for https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt in 1179.7ms Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/plain Content-Length: 1759 Connection: keep-alive We can see that we were redirected because response.request().url() is different from request.url() . The two log statements log two different URLs. Network Interceptors Registering a network interceptor is quite similar. Call addNetworkInterceptor() instead of addInterceptor() : OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient . Builder () . addNetworkInterceptor ( new LoggingInterceptor ()) . build (); Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://www.publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . header ( User-Agent , OkHttp Example ) . build (); Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute (); response . body (). close (); When we run this code, the interceptor runs twice.

The network interceptor s Chain has a non-null Connection that can be used to interrogate the IP address and TLS configuration that were used to connect to the webserver. Choosing between application and network interceptors Each interceptor chain has relative merits. Application interceptors Don t need to worry about intermediate responses like redirects and retries. Are always invoked once, even if the HTTP response is served from the cache. Observe the application s original intent. Unconcerned with OkHttp-injected headers like If-None-Match . Permitted to short-circuit and not call Chain.proceed() . Permitted to retry and make multiple calls to Chain.proceed() . Can adjust Call timeouts using withConnectTimeout, withReadTimeout, withWriteTimeout. Network Interceptors Able to operate on intermediate responses like redirects and retries. Not invoked for cached responses that short-circuit the network. Observe the data just as it will be transmitted over the network. Access to the Connection that carries the request. Rewriting Requests Interceptors can add, remove, or replace request headers. They can also transform the body of those requests that have one. For example, you can use an application interceptor to add request body compression if you re connecting to a webserver known to support it. /** This interceptor compresses the HTTP request body. Many webservers can t handle this! */ final class GzipRequestInterceptor implements Interceptor { @Override public Response intercept ( Interceptor . Chain chain ) throws IOException { Request originalRequest = chain . request (); if ( originalRequest . body () == null || originalRequest . header ( Content-Encoding ) != null ) { return chain . proceed ( originalRequest ); } Request compressedRequest = originalRequest . newBuilder () . header ( Content-Encoding , gzip ) . method ( originalRequest . method (), gzip ( originalRequest . body ())) . build (); return chain . proceed ( compressedRequest ); } private RequestBody gzip ( final RequestBody body ) { return new RequestBody () { @Override public MediaType contentType () { return body . contentType (); } @Override public long contentLength () { return - 1 ; // We don t know the compressed length in advance! } @Override public void writeTo ( BufferedSink sink ) throws IOException { BufferedSink gzipSink = Okio . buffer ( new GzipSink ( sink )); body . writeTo ( gzipSink ); gzipSink . close (); } }; } } Rewriting Responses Symmetrically, interceptors can rewrite response headers and transform the response body. This is generally more dangerous than rewriting request headers because it may violate the webserver s expectations! If you re in a tricky situation and prepared to deal with the consequences, rewriting response headers is a powerful way to work around problems. For example, you can fix a server s misconfigured Cache-Control response header to enable better response caching: /** Dangerous interceptor that rewrites the server s cache-control header. */ private static final Interceptor REWRITE_CACHE_CONTROL_INTERCEPTOR = new Interceptor () { @Override public Response intercept ( Interceptor .

Read through them to learn about how everything works together. Cut-and-paste these examples freely; that s what they re for. Synchronous Get ( .kt , .java ) Download a file, print its headers, and print its response body as a string. The string() method on response body is convenient and efficient for small documents. But if the response body is large (greater than 1 MiB), avoid string() because it will load the entire document into memory. In that case, prefer to process the body as a stream. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) for (( name , value ) in response . headers ) { println ( $name: $value ) } println ( response . body !! . string ()) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request .

The callback is made after the response headers are ready. Reading the response body may still block. OkHttp doesn t currently offer asynchronous APIs to receive a response body in parts. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . build () client . newCall ( request ). enqueue ( object : Callback { override fun onFailure ( call : Call , e : IOException ) { e . printStackTrace () } override fun onResponse ( call : Call , response : Response ) { response . use { if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) for (( name , value ) in response . headers ) { println ( $name: $value ) } println ( response . body !! . string ()) } } }) } Java private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request .

But some headers permit multiple values, like Guava s Multimap . For example, it s legal and common for an HTTP response to supply multiple Vary headers. OkHttp s APIs attempt to make both cases comfortable. When writing request headers, use header(name, value) to set the only occurrence of name to value . If there are existing values, they will be removed before the new value is added. Use addHeader(name, value) to add a header without removing the headers already present. When reading response a header, use header(name) to return the last occurrence of the named value. Usually this is also the only occurrence! If no value is present, header(name) will return null. To read all of a field s values as a list, use headers(name) . To visit all headers, use the Headers class which supports access by index. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues ) . header ( User-Agent , OkHttp Headers.java ) . addHeader ( Accept , application/json; q=0.5 ) . addHeader ( Accept , application/vnd.github.v3+json ) . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) println ( Server: ${response.header( Server )} ) println ( Date: ${response.header( Date )} ) println ( Vary: ${response.headers( Vary )} ) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues ) . header ( User-Agent , OkHttp Headers.java ) . addHeader ( Accept , application/json; q=0.5 ) . addHeader ( Accept , application/vnd.github.v3+json ) . build (); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response ); System . out . println ( Server: + response . header ( Server )); System . out . println ( Date: + response . header ( Date )); System . out . println ( Vary: + response . headers ( Vary )); } } Posting a String ( .kt , .java ) Use an HTTP POST to send a request body to a service. This example posts a markdown document to a web service that renders markdown as HTML. Because the entire request body is in memory simultaneously, avoid posting large (greater than 1 MiB) documents using this API. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val postBody = |Releases |-------- | | * _1.0_ May 6, 2013 | * _1.1_ June 15, 2013 | * _1.2_ August 11, 2013 | . trimMargin () val request = Request .

The content of this request body is being generated as it s being written. This example streams directly into the Okio buffered sink. Your programs may prefer an OutputStream , which you can get from BufferedSink.outputStream() . Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val requestBody = object : RequestBody () { override fun contentType () = MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN override fun writeTo ( sink : BufferedSink ) { sink . writeUtf8 ( Numbers\\n ) sink . writeUtf8 ( -------\\n ) for ( i in 2. . 997 ) { sink . writeUtf8 ( String . format ( * $i = ${factor(i)}\\n )) } } private fun factor ( n : Int ): String { for ( i in 2 until n ) { val x = n / i if ( x * i == n ) return ${factor(x)} \u00d7 $i } return n . toString () } } val request = Request .

Builder () . url ( https://api.github.com/markdown/raw ) . post ( requestBody ) . build (); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response ); System . out . println ( response . body (). string ()); } } Posting a File ( .kt , .java ) It s easy to use a file as a request body. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val file = File ( README.md ) val request = Request . Builder () . url ( https://api.github.com/markdown/raw ) . post ( file . asRequestBody ( MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN )) . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) println ( response . body !! . string ()) } } companion object { val MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN = text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8 . toMediaType () } Java public static final MediaType MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN = MediaType . parse ( text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8 ); private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { File file = new File ( README.md ); Request request = new Request .

Names and values will be encoded using an HTML-compatible form URL encoding. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val formBody = FormBody . Builder () . add ( search , Jurassic Park ) . build () val request = Request . Builder () . url ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php ) . post ( formBody ) . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) println ( response . body !! . string ()) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { RequestBody formBody = new FormBody . Builder () . add ( search , Jurassic Park ) . build (); Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php ) . post ( formBody ) . build (); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response ); System . out . println ( response . body (). string ()); } } Posting a multipart request ( .kt , .java ) MultipartBody.Builder can build sophisticated request bodies compatible with HTML file upload forms. Each part of a multipart request body is itself a request body, and can define its own headers. If present, these headers should describe the part body, such as its Content-Disposition . The Content-Length and Content-Type headers are added automatically if they re available. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { // Use the imgur image upload API as documented at https://api.imgur.com/endpoints/image val requestBody = MultipartBody .

Here we re using it to decode a JSON response from a GitHub API. Note that ResponseBody.charStream() uses the Content-Type response header to select which charset to use when decoding the response body. It defaults to UTF-8 if no charset is specified. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () private val moshi = Moshi . Builder (). build () private val gistJsonAdapter = moshi . adapter ( Gist :: class . java ) fun run () { val request = Request .

The cache directory should be private, and untrusted applications should not be able to read its contents! It is an error to have multiple caches accessing the same cache directory simultaneously. Most applications should call new OkHttpClient() exactly once, configure it with their cache, and use that same instance everywhere. Otherwise the two cache instances will stomp on each other, corrupt the response cache, and possibly crash your program. Response caching uses HTTP headers for all configuration. You can add request headers like Cache-Control: max-stale=3600 and OkHttp s cache will honor them. Your webserver configures how long responses are cached with its own response headers, like Cache-Control: max-age=9600 . There are cache headers to force a cached response, force a network response, or force the network response to be validated with a conditional GET. Kotlin private val client : OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient . Builder () . cache ( Cache ( directory = cacheDirectory , maxSize = 10L * 1024L * 1024L // 10 MiB )) . build () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . build () val response1Body = client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { if (! it . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $it ) println ( Response 1 response: $it ) println ( Response 1 cache response: ${it.cacheResponse} ) println ( Response 1 network response: ${it.networkResponse} ) return @use it . body !! . string () } val response2Body = client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { if (! it . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $it ) println ( Response 2 response: $it ) println ( Response 2 cache response: ${it.cacheResponse} ) println ( Response 2 network response: ${it.networkResponse} ) return @use it . body !! . string () } println ( Response 2 equals Response 1? + ( response1Body == response2Body )) } Java private final OkHttpClient client ; public CacheResponse ( File cacheDirectory ) throws Exception { int cacheSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024 ; // 10 MiB Cache cache = new Cache ( cacheDirectory , cacheSize ); client = new OkHttpClient . Builder () . cache ( cache ) . build (); } public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) . build (); String response1Body ; try ( Response response1 = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response1 . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response1 ); response1Body = response1 . body (). string (); System . out . println ( Response 1 response: + response1 ); System . out . println ( Response 1 cache response: + response1 . cacheResponse ()); System . out . println ( Response 1 network response: + response1 . networkResponse ()); } String response2Body ; try ( Response response2 = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response2 . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response2 ); response2Body = response2 . body (). string (); System . out . println ( Response 2 response: + response2 ); System . out . println ( Response 2 cache response: + response2 . cacheResponse ()); System . out . println ( Response 2 network response: + response2 . networkResponse ()); } System . out . println ( Response 2 equals Response 1? + response1Body . equals ( response2Body )); } To prevent a response from using the cache, use CacheControl.FORCE_NETWORK . To prevent it from using the network, use CacheControl.FORCE_CACHE . Be warned: if you use FORCE_CACHE and the response requires the network, OkHttp will return a 504 Unsatisfiable Request response. Canceling a Call ( .kt , .java ) Use Call.cancel() to stop an ongoing call immediately. If a thread is currently writing a request or reading a response, it will receive an IOException . Use this to conserve the network when a call is no longer necessary; for example when your user navigates away from an application. Both synchronous and asynchronous calls can be canceled. Kotlin private val executor = Executors . newScheduledThreadPool ( 1 ) private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/2 ) // This URL is served with a 2 second delay. . build () val startNanos = System . nanoTime () val call = client . newCall ( request ) // Schedule a job to cancel the call in 1 second. executor . schedule ({ System . out . printf ( %.2f Canceling call.%n , ( System . nanoTime () - startNanos ) / 1 e9f ) call . cancel () System . out . printf ( %.2f Canceled call.%n , ( System . nanoTime () - startNanos ) / 1 e9f ) }, 1 , TimeUnit .

Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/2 ) // This URL is served with a 2 second delay. . build (); final long startNanos = System . nanoTime (); final Call call = client . newCall ( request ); // Schedule a job to cancel the call in 1 second. executor . schedule ( new Runnable () { @Override public void run () { System . out . printf ( %.2f Canceling call.%n , ( System . nanoTime () - startNanos ) / 1e9f ); call . cancel (); System . out . printf ( %.2f Canceled call.%n , ( System . nanoTime () - startNanos ) / 1e9f ); } }, 1 , TimeUnit .

Network partitions can be due to client connectivity problems, server availability problems, or anything between. OkHttp supports connect, write, read, and full call timeouts. Kotlin private val client : OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient . Builder () . connectTimeout ( 5 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . writeTimeout ( 5 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . readTimeout ( 5 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . callTimeout ( 10 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . build () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/2 ) // This URL is served with a 2 second delay. . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - println ( Response completed: $response ) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client ; public ConfigureTimeouts () throws Exception { client = new OkHttpClient . Builder () . connectTimeout ( 10 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . writeTimeout ( 10 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . readTimeout ( 30 , TimeUnit . SECONDS ) . build (); } public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/2 ) // This URL is served with a 2 second delay. . build (); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { System . out . println ( Response completed: + response ); } } Per-call Configuration ( .kt , .java ) All the HTTP client configuration lives in OkHttpClient including proxy settings, timeouts, and caches. When you need to change the configuration of a single call, call OkHttpClient.newBuilder() . This returns a builder that shares the same connection pool, dispatcher, and configuration with the original client. In the example below, we make one request with a 500 ms timeout and another with a 3000 ms timeout. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/1 ) // This URL is served with a 1 second delay. . build () // Copy to customize OkHttp for this request. val client1 = client . newBuilder () . readTimeout ( 500 , TimeUnit . MILLISECONDS ) . build () try { client1 . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - println ( Response 1 succeeded: $response ) } } catch ( e : IOException ) { println ( Response 1 failed: $e ) } // Copy to customize OkHttp for this request. val client2 = client . newBuilder () . readTimeout ( 3000 , TimeUnit . MILLISECONDS ) . build () try { client2 . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - println ( Response 2 succeeded: $response ) } } catch ( e : IOException ) { println ( Response 2 failed: $e ) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient (); public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://httpbin.org/delay/1 ) // This URL is served with a 1 second delay. . build (); // Copy to customize OkHttp for this request. OkHttpClient client1 = client . newBuilder () . readTimeout ( 500 , TimeUnit . MILLISECONDS ) . build (); try ( Response response = client1 . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { System . out . println ( Response 1 succeeded: + response ); } catch ( IOException e ) { System . out . println ( Response 1 failed: + e ); } // Copy to customize OkHttp for this request. OkHttpClient client2 = client . newBuilder () . readTimeout ( 3000 , TimeUnit . MILLISECONDS ) . build (); try ( Response response = client2 . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { System . out . println ( Response 2 succeeded: + response ); } catch ( IOException e ) { System . out . println ( Response 2 failed: + e ); } } Handling authentication ( .kt , .java ) OkHttp can automatically retry unauthenticated requests. When a response is 401 Not Authorized , an Authenticator is asked to supply credentials. Implementations should build a new request that includes the missing credentials. If no credentials are available, return null to skip the retry. Use Response.challenges() to get the schemes and realms of any authentication challenges. When fulfilling a Basic challenge, use Credentials.basic(username, password) to encode the request header. Kotlin private val client = OkHttpClient . Builder () . authenticator ( object : Authenticator { @Throws ( IOException :: class ) override fun authenticate ( route : Route ?, response : Response ): Request ? { if ( response . request . header ( Authorization ) != null ) { return null // Give up, we ve already attempted to authenticate. } println ( Authenticating for response: $response ) println ( Challenges: ${response.challenges()} ) val credential = Credentials . basic ( jesse , password1 ) return response . request . newBuilder () . header ( Authorization , credential ) . build () } }) . build () fun run () { val request = Request . Builder () . url ( http://publicobject.com/secrets/hellosecret.txt ) . build () client . newCall ( request ). execute (). use { response - if (! response . isSuccessful ) throw IOException ( Unexpected code $response ) println ( response . body !! . string ()) } } Java private final OkHttpClient client ; public Authenticate () { client = new OkHttpClient . Builder () . authenticator ( new Authenticator () { @Override public Request authenticate ( Route route , Response response ) throws IOException { if ( response . request (). header ( Authorization ) != null ) { return null ; // Give up, we ve already attempted to authenticate. } System . out . println ( Authenticating for response: + response ); System . out . println ( Challenges: + response . challenges ()); String credential = Credentials . basic ( jesse , password1 ); return response . request (). newBuilder () . header ( Authorization , credential ) . build (); } }) . build (); } public void run () throws Exception { Request request = new Request . Builder () . url ( http://publicobject.com/secrets/hellosecret.txt ) . build (); try ( Response response = client . newCall ( request ). execute ()) { if ( ! response . isSuccessful ()) throw new IOException ( Unexpected code + response ); System . out . println ( response . body (). string ()); } } To avoid making many retries when authentication isn t working, you can return null to give up. For example, you may want to skip the retry when these exact credentials have already been attempted: if ( credential . equals ( response . request (). header ( Authorization ))) { return null ; // If we already failed with these credentials, don t retry. } You may also skip the retry when you\u2019ve hit an application-defined attempt limit: if ( responseCount ( response ) = 3 ) { return null ; // If we ve failed 3 times, give up. } This above code relies on this responseCount() method: private int responseCount ( Response response ) { int result = 1 ; while (( response = response . priorResponse ()) != null ) { result ++ ; } return result ; }","title":"Recipes"},{"location":"recipes/#recipes","text":"We ve written some recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems with OkHttp.

OkHttp s APIs attempt to make both cases comfortable. When writing request headers, use header(name, value) to set the only occurrence of name to value . If there are existing values, they will be removed before the new value is added. Use addHeader(name, value) to add a header without removing the headers already present. When reading response a header, use header(name) to return the last occurrence of the named value. Usually this is also the only occurrence! If no value is present, header(name) will return null. To read all of a field s values as a list, use headers(name) . To visit all headers, use the Headers class which supports access by index.

We\u2019ve chosen Kotlin because it gives us powerful new capabilities while integrating closely with Java. We spent a lot of time and energy on retaining strict compatibility with OkHttp 3.x. We\u2019re even keeping the package name the same: okhttp3 ! There are three kinds of compatibility we\u2019re tracking: Binary compatibility is the ability to compile a program against OkHttp 3.x, and then to run it against OkHttp 4.x. We\u2019re using the excellent japicmp library via its Gradle plugin to enforce binary compatibility. Java source compatibility is the ability to upgrade Java uses of OkHttp 3.x to 4.x without changing .java files. Kotlin source compatibility is the ability to upgrade Kotlin uses of OkHttp 3.x to 4.x without changing .kt files. With a few small exceptions (below), OkHttp 4.x is both binary- and Java source-compatible with OkHttp 3.x. You can use an OkHttp 4.x .jar file with applications or libraries built for OkHttp 3.x. OkHttp is not source-compatible for Kotlin callers, but upgrading should be automatic thanks to Kotlin\u2019s powerful deprecation features. Most developers should be able to use IntelliJ\u2019s Code Cleanup for a safe and fast upgrade. Backwards-Incompatible Changes OkHttpClient final methods OkHttpClient has 26 accessors like interceptors() and writeTimeoutMillis() that were non-final in OkHttp 3.x and are final in 4.x. These were made non-final for use with mocking frameworks like Mockito . We believe subtyping OkHttpClient is the wrong way to test with OkHttp. If you must, mock Call.Factory which is the interface that OkHttpClient implements. Internal API changes The okhttp3.internal package is not a published API and we change it frequently without warning. Depending on code in this package is bad and will cause you problems with any upgrade! But the 4.x will be particularly painful to naughty developers that import from this package! We changed a lot to take advantage of sweet Kotlin features. Credentials.basic() The username and password parameters to Credentials.basic() are now non-null strings. In OkHttp 3.x, null would yield a username or password of null . HttpUrl.queryParameterValues() The return type of HttpUrl.queryParameterValues() is List String? . Lists that may contain null are uncommon and Kotlin callers may have incorrectly assigned the result to List String . Code Cleanup IntelliJ and Android Studio offer a Code Cleanup feature that will automatically update deprecated APIs with their replacements. Access this feature from the Search Anywhere dialog (double-press shift) or under the Analyze menu. We\u2019ve included deprecated APIs in OkHttp 4.0 because they make migration easy. We will remove them in a future release! If you\u2019re skipping releases, it\u2019ll be much easier if you upgrade to OkHttp 4.0 as an intermediate step. Vars and Vals Java doesn\u2019t have language support for properties so developers make do with getters and setters. Kotlin does have properties and we take advantage of them in OkHttp.

Extension Functions We\u2019ve migrated from static functions to extension functions where we think they fit. Java Kotlin Handshake.get(SSLSession) SSLSession.handshake() Headers.of(Map ) Map .toHeaders() HttpUrl.get(String) String.toHttpUrl() HttpUrl.get(URI) URI.toHttpUrlOrNull() HttpUrl.get(URL) URL.toHttpUrlOrNull() HttpUrl.parse(String) String.toHttpUrlOrNull() HttpUrl.uri() HttpUrl.toUri() HttpUrl.url() HttpUrl.toUrl() MediaType.get(String) String.toMediaType() MediaType.parse(String) String.toMediaTypeOrNull() RequestBody.create(ByteArray) ByteArray.toRequestBody() RequestBody.create(ByteString) ByteString.toRequestBody() RequestBody.create(File) File.asRequestBody() RequestBody.create(String) String.toRequestBody() ResponseBody.create(BufferedSource) BufferedSource.asResponseBody() ResponseBody.create(ByteArray) ByteArray.toResponseBody() ResponseBody.create(ByteString) ByteString.toResponseBody() ResponseBody.create(String) String.toResponseBody() SAM Conversions When you use Java APIs from Kotlin you can operate on Java interfaces as if they were Kotlin lambdas. The feature is available for interfaces that define a Single Abstract Method (SAM). But when you use Kotlin APIs from Kotlin there\u2019s no automatic conversion. Code that used SAM lambdas with OkHttp 3.x: must use object : with OkHttp 4.x: Kotlin calling OkHttp 3.x: val client = OkHttpClient . Builder () . dns { hostname - InetAddress . getAllByName ( hostname ). toList () } . build () Kotlin calling OkHttp 4.x: val client = OkHttpClient . Builder () . dns ( object : Dns { override fun lookup ( hostname : String ) = InetAddress . getAllByName ( hostname ). toList () }) . build () SAM conversion impacts these APIs: Authenticator Dispatcher.setIdleCallback(Runnable) Dns EventListener.Factory HttpLoggingInterceptor.Logger LoggingEventListener.Factory OkHttpClient.Builder.hostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier) JetBrains is working on SAM conversions of Kotlin interfaces. Expect it in a future release of the Kotlin language. Companion Imports The equivalent of static methods in Java is companion object functions in Kotlin. The bytecode is the same but .kt files now need Companion in the import. This works with OkHttp 3.x: import okhttp3.CipherSuite.forJavaName But OkHttp 4.x needs a Companion : import okhttp3.CipherSuite.Companion.forJavaName In the unlikely event that you have a lot of these, run this: sed -i \\ s/^\\(import okhttp3\\.[^.]*\\)\\.\\([a-z][a-zA-Z]*\\)$/\\1.Companion.\\2/g \\ ` find . -name *.kt ` Advanced Profiling Android Studio\u2019s Advanced Profiling feature rewrites OkHttp bytecode for instrumentation. Unfortunately it crashes on OkHttp 4.x\u2019s bytecode. Until Google\u2019s bug is fixed you must disable advanced profiling in Android Studio. R8 / ProGuard R8 and ProGuard are both code optimizers for .class files. R8 is the default optimizer in Android Studio 3.4 and newer. It works well with all releases of OkHttp. ProGuard was the previous default. We\u2019re tracking problems with interactions between ProGuard, OkHttp 4.x, and Kotlin-originated .class files. Make sure you\u2019re on the latest release if you\u2019re using ProGuard, Gradle OkHttp 4\u2019s minimum requirements are Java 8+ and Android 5+. These requirements were first introduced with OkHttp 3.13.

The client is unblocked and free to continue as soon as it has received the entire response body. If and when the client makes a subsequent request using a pooled socket the server may not have had time to close the socket. The socket will be closed at an indeterminate point before or during the second request. It may be closed after client has started sending the request body.

Add delays in the client to improve the chances that the server has closed the socket before follow up requests are made. Enum Values Name Summary SHUTDOWN_SERVER_AFTER_RESPONSE Shutdown MockWebServer after writing response. KEEP_OPEN Keep the socket open after the response. This is the default HTTP/1.1 behavior.

For secure connections the address also includes the SSL socket factory, hostname verifier, and certificate pinner. | okhttp3.Authenticator Performs either preemptive authentication before connecting to a proxy server, or reactive authentication after receiving a challenge from either an origin web server or proxy server. | okhttp3.Cache Caches HTTP and HTTPS responses to the filesystem so they may be reused, saving time and bandwidth. | okhttp3.CacheControl A Cache-Control header with cache directives from a server or client. These directives set policy on what responses can be stored, and which requests can be satisfied by those stored responses. | okhttp3.Call A call is a request that has been prepared for execution. A call can be canceled. As this object represents a single request/response pair (stream), it cannot be executed twice. | okhttp3.Callback | okhttp3.CertificatePinner Constrains which certificates are trusted. Pinning certificates defends against attacks on certificate authorities. It also prevents connections through man-in-the-middle certificate authorities either known or unknown to the application s user.

Pins are either base64 SHA-256 hashes as in HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) or SHA-1 base64 hashes as in Chromium s static certificates . | okhttp3.Challenge An RFC 7235 challenge. | okhttp3.CipherSuite TLS cipher suites . | okhttp3.Connection The sockets and streams of an HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTPS+HTTP/2 connection. May be used for multiple HTTP request/response exchanges. Connections may be direct to the origin server or via a proxy. | okhttp3.ConnectionPool Manages reuse of HTTP and HTTP/2 connections for reduced network latency. HTTP requests that share the same Address may share a Connection . This class implements the policy of which connections to keep open for future use. | okhttp3.ConnectionSpec Specifies configuration for the socket connection that HTTP traffic travels through. For https: URLs, this includes the TLS version and cipher suites to use when negotiating a secure connection. | okhttp3.Cookie An RFC 6265 Cookie. | okhttp3.CookieJar Provides policy and persistence for HTTP cookies. | okhttp3.Credentials Factory for HTTP authorization credentials. | okhttp3.Dispatcher Policy on when async requests are executed. | okhttp3.Dns A domain name service that resolves IP addresses for host names. Most applications will use the system DNS service , which is the default. Some applications may provide their own implementation to use a different DNS server, to prefer IPv6 addresses, to prefer IPv4 addresses, or to force a specific known IP address. | okhttp3.EventListener Listener for metrics events. Extend this class to monitor the quantity, size, and duration of your application s HTTP calls. | okhttp3.FormBody | okhttp3.Handshake A record of a TLS handshake. For HTTPS clients, the client is local and the remote server is its peer . | okhttp3.Headers The header fields of a single HTTP message. Values are uninterpreted strings; use Request and Response for interpreted headers. This class maintains the order of the header fields within the HTTP message. | okhttp3.HttpUrl A uniform resource locator (URL) with a scheme of either http or https . Use this class to compose and decompose Internet addresses. For example, this code will compose and print a URL for Google search: | okhttp3.Interceptor Observes, modifies, and potentially short-circuits requests going out and the corresponding responses coming back in. Typically interceptors add, remove, or transform headers on the request or response. | okhttp3.MediaType An RFC 2045 Media Type, appropriate to describe the content type of an HTTP request or response body. | okhttp3.MultipartBody An RFC 2387 -compliant request body. | okhttp3.MultipartReader Reads a stream of RFC 2046 multipart body parts.

Instances of this class are immutable if their body is null or itself immutable. | okhttp3.RequestBody | okhttp3.Response An HTTP response. Instances of this class are not immutable: the response body is a one-shot value that may be consumed only once and then closed. All other properties are immutable. | okhttp3.ResponseBody A one-shot stream from the origin server to the client application with the raw bytes of the response body. Each response body is supported by an active connection to the webserver. This imposes both obligations and limits on the client application. | okhttp3.Route The concrete route used by a connection to reach an abstract origin server. When creating a connection the client has many options: | okhttp3.TlsVersion Versions of TLS that can be offered when negotiating a secure socket.

Cache Optimization To measure cache effectiveness, this class tracks three statistics: Request Count: the number of HTTP requests issued since this cache was created. Network Count: the number of those requests that required network use. Hit Count: the number of those requests whose responses were served by the cache. Sometimes a request will result in a conditional cache hit. If the cache contains a stale copy of the response, the client will issue a conditional GET . The server will then send either the updated response if it has changed, or a short not modified response if the client s copy is still valid. Such responses increment both the network count and hit count. The best way to improve the cache hit rate is by configuring the web server to return cacheable responses. Although this client honors all HTTP/1.1 (RFC 7234) cache headers, it doesn t cache partial responses. Force a Network Response In some situations, such as after a user clicks a refresh button, it may be necessary to skip the cache, and fetch data directly from the server. To force a full refresh, add the no-cache directive: Request request = new Request.Builder() .cacheControl(new CacheControl.Builder().noCache().build()) .url( http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) .build(); If it is only necessary to force a cached response to be validated by the server, use the more efficient max-age=0 directive instead: Request request = new Request.Builder() .cacheControl(new CacheControl.Builder() .maxAge(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .build()) .url( http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt ) .build(); Force a Cache Response Sometimes you ll want to show resources if they are available immediately, but not otherwise. This can be used so your application can show something while waiting for the latest data to be downloaded.

Pinning certificates defends against attacks on certificate authorities. It also prevents connections through man-in-the-middle certificate authorities either known or unknown to the application s user. This class currently pins a certificate s Subject Public Key Info as described on Adam Langley s Weblog . Pins are either base64 SHA-256 hashes as in HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) or SHA-1 base64 hashes as in Chromium s static certificates . Setting up Certificate Pinning The easiest way to pin a host is turn on pinning with a broken configuration and read the expected configuration when the connection fails. Be sure to do this on a trusted network, and without man-in-the-middle tools like Charles or Fiddler . For example, to pin https://publicobject.com , start with a broken configuration: String hostname = publicobject.com ; CertificatePinner certificatePinner = new CertificatePinner.Builder() .add(hostname, sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA= ) .build(); OkHttpClient client = OkHttpClient.Builder() .certificatePinner(certificatePinner) .build(); Request request = new Request.Builder() .url( https:// + hostname) .build(); client.newCall(request).execute(); As expected, this fails with a certificate pinning exception: javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: Certificate pinning failure!

To pin both publicobject.com and www.publicobject.com you must configure both hostnames. Or you may use patterns to match sets of related domain names. The following forms are permitted: Full domain name : you may pin an exact domain name like www.publicobject.com . It won t match additional prefixes ( us-west.www.publicobject.com ) or suffixes ( publicobject.com ). Any number of subdomains : Use two asterisks to like **.publicobject.com to match any number of prefixes ( us-west.www.publicobject.com , www.publicobject.com ) including no prefix at all ( publicobject.com ). For most applications this is the best way to configure certificate pinning. Exactly one subdomain : Use a single asterisk like *.publicobject.com to match exactly one prefix ( www.publicobject.com , api.publicobject.com ). Be careful with this approach as no pinning will be enforced if additional prefixes are present, or if no prefixes are present. Note that any other form is unsupported. You may not use asterisks in any position other than the leftmost label. If multiple patterns match a hostname, any match is sufficient. For example, suppose pin A applies to *.publicobject.com and pin B applies to api.publicobject.com . Handshakes for api.publicobject.com are valid if either A s or B s certificate is in the chain. Warning: Certificate Pinning is Dangerous! Pinning certificates limits your server team s abilities to update their TLS certificates. By pinning certificates, you take on additional operational complexity and limit your ability to migrate between certificate authorities. Do not use certificate pinning without the blessing of your server s TLS administrator! Note about self-signed certificates CertificatePinner can not be used to pin self-signed certificate if such certificate is not accepted by javax.net.ssl.TrustManager .

May be used for multiple HTTP request/response exchanges. Connections may be direct to the origin server or via a proxy. Typically instances of this class are created, connected and exercised automatically by the HTTP client. Applications may use this class to monitor HTTP connections as members of a connection pool . Do not confuse this class with the misnamed HttpURLConnection , which isn t so much a connection as a single request/response exchange. Modern TLS There are trade-offs when selecting which options to include when negotiating a secure connection to a remote host. Newer TLS options are quite useful: Server Name Indication (SNI) enables one IP address to negotiate secure connections for multiple domain names. Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) enables the HTTPS port (443) to be used to negotiate HTTP/2. Unfortunately, older HTTPS servers refuse to connect when such options are presented. Rather than avoiding these options entirely, this class allows a connection to be attempted with modern options and then retried without them should the attempt fail. Connection Reuse Each connection can carry a varying number of streams, depending on the underlying protocol being used. HTTP/1.x connections can carry either zero or one streams. HTTP/2 connections can carry any number of streams, dynamically configured with SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS . A connection currently carrying zero streams is an idle stream. We keep it alive because reusing an existing connection is typically faster than establishing a new one. When a single logical call requires multiple streams due to redirects or authorization challenges, we prefer to use the same physical connection for all streams in the sequence. There are potential performance and behavior consequences to this preference. To support this feature, this class separates allocations from streams . An allocation is created by a call, used for one or more streams, and then released. An allocated connection won t be stolen by other calls while a redirect or authorization challenge is being handled. When the maximum concurrent streams limit is reduced, some allocations will be rescinded. Attempting to create new streams on these allocations will fail. Note that an allocation may be released before its stream is completed. This is intended to make bookkeeping easier for the caller: releasing the allocation as soon as the terminal stream has been found.

Use this class to compose and decompose Internet addresses. For example, this code will compose and print a URL for Google search: HttpUrl url = new HttpUrl.Builder() .scheme( https ) .host( www.google.com ) .addPathSegment( search ) .addQueryParameter( q , polar bears ) .build(); System.out.println(url); which prints: https://www.google.com/search?q=polar%20bears As another example, this code prints the human-readable query parameters of a Twitter search: HttpUrl url = HttpUrl.parse( https://twitter.com/search?q=cute%20%23puppies f=images ); for (int i = 0, size = url.querySize(); i size; i++) { System.out.println(url.queryParameterName(i) + : + url.queryParameterValue(i)); } which prints: q: cute #puppies f: images In addition to composing URLs from their component parts and decomposing URLs into their component parts, this class implements relative URL resolution: what address you d reach by clicking a relative link on a specified page. For example: HttpUrl base = HttpUrl.parse( https://www.youtube.com/user/WatchTheDaily/videos ); HttpUrl link = base.resolve( ../../watch?v=cbP2N1BQdYc ); System.out.println(link); which prints: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbP2N1BQdYc What s in a URL? A URL has several components. Scheme Sometimes referred to as protocol , A URL s scheme describes what mechanism should be used to retrieve the resource. Although URLs have many schemes ( mailto , file , ftp ), this class only supports http and https . Use java.net.URI for URLs with arbitrary schemes. Username and Password Username and password are either present, or the empty string \"\" if absent. This class offers no mechanism to differentiate empty from absent. Neither of these components are popular in practice. Typically HTTP applications use other mechanisms for user identification and authentication. Host The host identifies the webserver that serves the URL s resource. It is either a hostname like square.com or localhost , an IPv4 address like 192.168.0.1 , or an IPv6 address like ::1 . Usually a webserver is reachable with multiple identifiers: its IP addresses, registered domain names, and even localhost when connecting from the server itself. Each of a web server s names is a distinct URL and they are not interchangeable. For example, even if http://square.github.io/dagger and http://google.github.io/dagger are served by the same IP address, the two URLs identify different resources. Port The port used to connect to the web server. By default this is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. This class never returns -1 for the port: if no port is explicitly specified in the URL then the scheme s default is used. Path The path identifies a specific resource on the host. Paths have a hierarchical structure like /square/okhttp/issues/1486 and decompose into a list of segments like [\"square\", \"okhttp\", \"issues\", \"1486\"] . This class offers methods to compose and decompose paths by segment. It composes each path from a list of segments by alternating between / and the encoded segment. For example the segments [\"a\", \"b\"] build /a/b and the segments [\"a\", \"b\", \"\"] build /a/b/ . If a path s last segment is the empty string then the path ends with / . This class always builds non-empty paths: if the path is omitted it defaults to / . The default path s segment list is a single empty string: [\"\"] . Query The query is optional: it can be null, empty, or non-empty. For many HTTP URLs the query string is subdivided into a collection of name-value parameters. This class offers methods to set the query as the single string, or as individual name-value parameters. With name-value parameters the values are optional and names may be repeated. Fragment The fragment is optional: it can be null, empty, or non-empty. Unlike host, port, path, and query the fragment is not sent to the webserver: it s private to the client. Encoding Each component must be encoded before it is embedded in the complete URL. As we saw above, the string cute #puppies is encoded as cute%20%23puppies when used as a query parameter value. Percent encoding Percent encoding replaces a character (like \\ud83c\\udf69 ) with its UTF-8 hex bytes (like %F0%9F%8D%A9 ). This approach works for whitespace characters, control characters, non-ASCII characters, and characters that already have another meaning in a particular context. Percent encoding is used in every URL component except for the hostname. But the set of characters that need to be encoded is different for each component. For example, the path component must escape all of its ? characters, otherwise it could be interpreted as the start of the URL s query. But within the query and fragment components, the ? character doesn t delimit anything and doesn t need to be escaped. HttpUrl url = HttpUrl.parse( http://who-let-the-dogs.out ).newBuilder() .addPathSegment( _Who?_ ) .query( _Who?_ ) .fragment( _Who?_ ) .build(); System.out.println(url); This prints: http://who-let-the-dogs.out/_Who%3F_?_Who?_#_Who?_ When parsing URLs that lack percent encoding where it is required, this class will percent encode the offending characters. IDNA Mapping and Punycode encoding Hostnames have different requirements and use a different encoding scheme. It consists of IDNA mapping and Punycode encoding. In order to avoid confusion and discourage phishing attacks, IDNA Mapping transforms names to avoid confusing characters. This includes basic case folding: transforming shouting SQUARE.COM into cool and casual square.com . It also handles more exotic characters. For example, the Unicode trademark sign (\u2122) could be confused for the letters TM in http://ho\u2122mail.com . To mitigate this, the single character (\u2122) maps to the string . There is similar policy for all of the 1.1 million Unicode code points. Note that some code points such as \\ud83c\\udf69 are not mapped and cannot be used in a hostname. Punycode converts a Unicode string to an ASCII string to make international domain names work everywhere. For example, \u03c3 encodes as xn 4xa . The encoded string is not human readable, but can be used with classes like InetAddress to establish connections. Why another URL model? Java includes both java.net.URL and java.net.URI . We offer a new URL model to address problems that the others don t. Different URLs should be different Although they have different content, java.net.URL considers the following two URLs equal, and the equals() method between them returns true: http://square.github.io/ http://google.github.io/ This is because those two hosts share the same IP address. This is an old, bad design decision that makes java.net.URL unusable for many things. It shouldn t be used as a Map key or in a Set . Doing so is both inefficient because equality may require a DNS lookup, and incorrect because unequal URLs may be equal because of how they are hosted. Equal URLs should be equal These two URLs are semantically identical, but java.net.URI disagrees: http://host:80/ http://host Both the unnecessary port specification ( :80 ) and the absent trailing slash ( / ) cause URI to bucket the two URLs separately. This harms URI s usefulness in collections. Any application that stores information-per-URL will need to either canonicalize manually, or suffer unnecessary redundancy for such URLs. Because they don t attempt canonical form, these classes are surprisingly difficult to use securely. Suppose you re building a webservice that checks that incoming paths are prefixed /static/images/ before serving the corresponding assets from the filesystem. String attack = http://example.com/static/images/../../../../../etc/passwd ; System.out.println(new URL(attack).getPath()); System.out.println(new URI(attack).getPath()); System.out.println(HttpUrl.parse(attack).encodedPath()); By canonicalizing the input paths, they are complicit in directory traversal attacks. Code that checks only the path prefix may suffer! /static/images/../../../../../etc/passwd /static/images/../../../../../etc/passwd /etc/passwd If it works on the web, it should work in your application The java.net.URI class is strict around what URLs it accepts. It rejects URLs like http://example.com/abc|def because the | character is unsupported. This class is more forgiving: it will automatically percent-encode the |' yielding http://example.com/abc%7Cdef . This kind behavior is consistent with web browsers. HttpUrl prefers consistency with major web browsers over consistency with obsolete specifications. Paths and Queries should decompose Neither of the built-in URL models offer direct access to path segments or query parameters. Manually using StringBuilder to assemble these components is cumbersome: do + characters get silently replaced with spaces? If a query parameter contains a , does that get escaped? By offering methods to read and write individual query parameters directly, application developers are saved from the hassles of encoding and decoding. Plus a modern API The URL (JDK1.0) and URI (Java 1.4) classes predate builders and instead use telescoping constructors. For example, there s no API to compose a URI with a custom port without also providing a query and fragment. Instances of HttpUrl are well-formed and always have a scheme, host, and path. With java.net.URL it s possible to create an awkward URL like http:/ with scheme and path but no hostname. Building APIs that consume such malformed values is difficult! This class has a modern API. It avoids punitive checked exceptions: toHttpUrl throws IllegalArgumentException on invalid input or toHttpUrlOrNull returns null if the input is an invalid URL. You can even be explicit about whether each component has been encoded already.

Percent encoding is used in every URL component except for the hostname. But the set of characters that need to be encoded is different for each component. For example, the path component must escape all of its ? characters, otherwise it could be interpreted as the start of the URL s query. But within the query and fragment components, the ? character doesn t delimit anything and doesn t need to be escaped.

For example, the Unicode trademark sign (\u2122) could be confused for the letters TM in http://ho\u2122mail.com . To mitigate this, the single character (\u2122) maps to the string . There is similar policy for all of the 1.1 million Unicode code points. Note that some code points such as \\ud83c\\udf69 are not mapped and cannot be used in a hostname.

OkHttpClients Should Be Shared OkHttp performs best when you create a single OkHttpClient instance and reuse it for all of your HTTP calls. This is because each client holds its own connection pool and thread pools. Reusing connections and threads reduces latency and saves memory. Conversely, creating a client for each request wastes resources on idle pools.

Note that the connection pool s daemon thread may not exit immediately. client.connectionPool().evictAll(); If your client has a cache, call close() . Note that it is an error to create calls against a cache that is closed, and doing so will cause the call to crash. client.cache().close(); OkHttp also uses daemon threads for HTTP/2 connections.

Server Authentication This is the most common form of TLS authentication: clients verify that servers are trusted and that they own the hostnames that they represent. Server authentication is required. To perform server authentication: The server s handshake certificates must have a held certificate (a certificate and its private key). The certificate s subject alternative names must match the server s hostname. The server must also have is a (possibly-empty) chain of intermediate certificates to establish trust from a root certificate to the server s certificate. The root certificate is not included in this chain. The client s handshake certificates must include a set of trusted root certificates. They will be used to authenticate the server s certificate chain. Typically this is a set of well-known root certificates that is distributed with the HTTP client or its platform. It may be augmented by certificates private to an organization or service. Client Authentication This is authentication of the client by the server during the TLS handshake. Client authentication is optional. To perform client authentication: The client s handshake certificates must have a held certificate (a certificate and its private key). The client must also have a (possibly-empty) chain of intermediate certificates to establish trust from a root certificate to the client s certificate.

A subject alternative name is either a literal hostname ( squareup.com ), a literal IP address ( 74.122.190.80 ), or a hostname pattern ( *.api.squareup.com ). A validity interval. A certificate should not be used before its validity interval starts or after it ends. A public key. This cryptographic key is used for asymmetric encryption digital signatures.
