 * What should be done with the incoming socket.
 *
 * Be careful when using values like [DISCONNECT_AT_END], [SHUTDOWN_INPUT_AT_END]
 * and [SHUTDOWN_OUTPUT_AT_END] that close a socket after a response, and where there are
 * follow-up requests. The client is unblocked and free to continue as soon as it has received the
 * entire response body. If and when the client makes a subsequent request using a pooled socket the
 * server may not have had time to close the socket. The socket will be closed at an indeterminate
 * point before or during the second request. It may be closed after client has started sending the
 * request body. If a request body is not retryable then the client may fail the request, making
 * client behavior non-deterministic. Add delays in the client to improve the chances that the
 * server has closed the socket before follow up requests are made.
