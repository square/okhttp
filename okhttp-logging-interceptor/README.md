Logging Interceptor
===================

An [OkHttp interceptor][1] which logs HTTP request and response data.

```java
HttpLoggingInterceptor logging = new HttpLoggingInterceptor();
logging.setLevel(Level.BASIC);
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
  .addInterceptor(logging)
  .build();
```

You can change the log level at any time by calling `setLevel`.

To log to a custom location, pass a `Logger` instance to the constructor.
```java
HttpLoggingInterceptor logging = new HttpLoggingInterceptor(new Logger() {
  @Override public void log(String message) {
    Timber.tag("OkHttp").d(message);
  }
});
```

To log specific `Content-Type` of body in `BODY` level, pass an array of allowed `Content-Type`.

```java
HttpLoggingInterceptor logging = new HttpLoggingInterceptor(logger,
  new MediaType[]{MediaType.parse("text/*"), MediaType.parse("application/json")});
```

By default, only `text/*` and `application/json` are logged in `BODY` level.


**Warning**: The logs generated by this interceptor when using the `HEADERS` or `BODY` levels has
the potential to leak sensitive information such as "Authorization" or "Cookie" headers and the
contents of request and response bodies. This data should only be logged in a controlled way or in
a non-production environment.
