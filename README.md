OkHttp
======

An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. For more information see [the
website][website] and [the wiki][wiki].


Requirements
------------

OkHttp works on Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) and on Java 8+.

OkHttp has one library dependency on [Okio][okio], a small library for high-performance I/O. It
works with either Okio 1.x (implemented in Java) or Okio 2.x (upgraded to Kotlin).

We highly recommend you keep OkHttp up-to-date. As with auto-updating web browsers, staying current
with HTTPS clients is an important defense against potential security problems. [We
track][tls_history] the dynamic TLS ecosystem and adjust OkHttp to improve connectivity and
security.

OkHttp uses your platform's built-in TLS implementation. On Java platforms OkHttp also supports
[Conscrypt][conscrypt], which integrates BoringSSL with Java. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if it is
the first security provider:

```java
Security.insertProviderAt(Conscrypt.newProvider(), 1);
```

The OkHttp 3.12.x branch supports Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java 7+. These platforms lack
support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is difficult we will backport
critical fixes to the [3.12.x branch][okhttp_312x] through December 31, 2020.

Download
--------

Download [the latest JAR][okhttp_latest_jar] or configure this dependency:

```kotlin
implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.14.1")
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].


MockWebServer
-------------

A library for testing HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 clients.

MockWebServer coupling with OkHttp is essential for proper testing of HTTP/2 so that code can be shared.

### Download

Download [the latest JAR][mockwebserver_latest_jar] or configure this dependency:
```xml
testImplementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:3.14.1")
```

R8 / ProGuard
-------------

If you are using R8 or ProGuard add the options from [`okhttp3.pro`][okhttp3_pro].

You might also need rules for Okio which is a dependency of this library.
