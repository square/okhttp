/**
 * An {@link java.net.URLConnection} for HTTP (<a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>) used to send and
 * receive data over the web. Data may be of any type and length. This class may
 * be used to send and receive streaming data whose length is not known in
 * advance.
 *
 * <p>Uses of this class follow a pattern:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Obtain a new {@code HttpURLConnection} by calling {@link
 *       java.net.URL#openConnection() URL.openConnection()} and casting the result to
 *       {@code HttpURLConnection}.
 *   <li>Prepare the request. The primary property of a request is its URI.
 *       Request headers may also include metadata such as credentials, preferred
 *       content types, and session cookies.
 *   <li>Optionally upload a request body. Instances must be configured with
 *       {@link #setDoOutput(boolean) setDoOutput(true)} if they include a
 *       request body. Transmit data by writing to the stream returned by {@link
 *       #getOutputStream()}.
 *   <li>Read the response. Response headers typically include metadata such as
 *       the response body's content type and length, modified dates and session
 *       cookies. The response body may be read from the stream returned by {@link
 *       #getInputStream()}. If the response has no body, that method returns an
 *       empty stream.
 *   <li>Disconnect. Once the response body has been read, the {@code
 *       HttpURLConnection} should be closed by calling {@link #disconnect()}.
 *       Disconnecting releases the resources held by a connection so they may
 *       be closed or reused.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>For example, to retrieve the webpage at {@code http://www.android.com/}:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   URL url = new URL("http://www.android.com/");
 *   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
 *   try {
 *     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
 *     readStream(in);
 *   } finally {
 *     urlConnection.disconnect();
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Secure Communication with HTTPS</h3>
 * Calling {@link java.net.URL#openConnection()} on a URL with the "https"
 * scheme will return an {@code HttpsURLConnection}, which allows for
 * overriding the default {@link javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier
 * HostnameVerifier} and {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory
 * SSLSocketFactory}. An application-supplied {@code SSLSocketFactory}
 * created from an {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext SSLContext} can
 * provide a custom {@link javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager
 * X509TrustManager} for verifying certificate chains and a custom
 * {@link javax.net.ssl.X509KeyManager X509KeyManager} for supplying
 * client certificates. See {@link OkHttpsConnection HttpsURLConnection} for
 * more details.
 *
 * <h3>Response Handling</h3>
 * {@code HttpURLConnection} will follow up to five HTTP redirects. It will
 * follow redirects from one origin server to another. This implementation
 * doesn't follow redirects from HTTPS to HTTP or vice versa.
 *
 * <p>If the HTTP response indicates that an error occurred, {@link
 * #getInputStream()} will throw an {@link java.io.IOException}. Use {@link
 * #getErrorStream()} to read the error response. The headers can be read in
 * the normal way using {@link #getHeaderFields()},
 *
 * <h3>Posting Content</h3>
 * To upload data to a web server, configure the connection for output using
 * {@link #setDoOutput(boolean) setDoOutput(true)}.
 *
 * <p>For best performance, you should call either {@link
 * #setFixedLengthStreamingMode(int)} when the body length is known in advance,
 * or {@link #setChunkedStreamingMode(int)} when it is not. Otherwise {@code
 * HttpURLConnection} will be forced to buffer the complete request body in
 * memory before it is transmitted, wasting (and possibly exhausting) heap and
 * increasing latency.
 *
 * <p>For example, to perform an upload: <pre>   {@code
 *   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
 *   try {
 *     urlConnection.setDoOutput(true);
 *     urlConnection.setChunkedStreamingMode(0);
 *
 *     OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(urlConnection.getOutputStream());
 *     writeStream(out);
 *
 *     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
 *     readStream(in);
 *   } finally {
 *     urlConnection.disconnect();
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * The input and output streams returned by this class are <strong>not
 * buffered</strong>. Most callers should wrap the returned streams with {@link
 * java.io.BufferedInputStream BufferedInputStream} or {@link
 * java.io.BufferedOutputStream BufferedOutputStream}. Callers that do only bulk
 * reads or writes may omit buffering.
 *
 * <p>When transferring large amounts of data to or from a server, use streams
 * to limit how much data is in memory at once. Unless you need the entire
 * body to be in memory at once, process it as a stream (rather than storing
 * the complete body as a single byte array or string).
 *
 * <p>To reduce latency, this class may reuse the same underlying {@code Socket}
 * for multiple request/response pairs. As a result, HTTP connections may be
 * held open longer than necessary. Calls to {@link #disconnect()} may return
 * the socket to a pool of connected sockets. This behavior can be disabled by
 * setting the {@code http.keepAlive} system property to {@code false} before
 * issuing any HTTP requests. The {@code http.maxConnections} property may be
 * used to control how many idle connections to each server will be held.
 *
 * <p>By default, this implementation of {@code HttpURLConnection} requests that
 * servers use gzip compression. Since {@link #getContentLength()} returns the
 * number of bytes transmitted, you cannot use that method to predict how many
 * bytes can be read from {@link #getInputStream()}. Instead, read that stream
 * until it is exhausted: when {@link java.io.InputStream#read} returns -1. Gzip
 * compression can be disabled by setting the acceptable encodings in the
 * request header: <pre>   {@code
 *   urlConnection.setRequestProperty("Accept-Encoding", "identity");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Handling Network Sign-On</h3>
 * Some Wi-Fi networks block Internet access until the user clicks through a
 * sign-on page. Such sign-on pages are typically presented by using HTTP
 * redirects. You can use {@link #getURL()} to test if your connection has been
 * unexpectedly redirected. This check is not valid until <strong>after</strong>
 * the response headers have been received, which you can trigger by calling
 * {@link #getHeaderFields()} or {@link #getInputStream()}. For example, to
 * check that a response was not redirected to an unexpected host:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
 *   try {
 *     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
 *     if (!url.getHost().equals(urlConnection.getURL().getHost())) {
 *       // we were redirected! Kick the user out to the browser to sign on?
 *     }
 *     ...
 *   } finally {
 *     urlConnection.disconnect();
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>HTTP Authentication</h3>
 * {@code HttpURLConnection} supports <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617">HTTP basic authentication</a>. Use
 * {@link java.net.Authenticator} to set the VM-wide authentication handler:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   Authenticator.setDefault(new Authenticator() {
 *     protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
 *       return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password.toCharArray());
 *     }
 *   });
 * }</pre>
 * Unless paired with HTTPS, this is <strong>not</strong> a secure mechanism for
 * user authentication. In particular, the username, password, request and
 * response are all transmitted over the network without encryption.
 *
 * <h3>Sessions with Cookies</h3>
 * To establish and maintain a potentially long-lived session between client
 * and server, {@code HttpURLConnection} includes an extensible cookie manager.
 * Enable VM-wide cookie management using {@link java.net.CookieHandler} and {@link
 * java.net.CookieManager}: <pre>   {@code
 *   CookieManager cookieManager = new CookieManager();
 *   CookieHandler.setDefault(cookieManager);
 * }</pre>
 * By default, {@code CookieManager} accepts cookies from the <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html">origin
 * server</a> only. Two other policies are included: {@link
 * java.net.CookiePolicy#ACCEPT_ALL} and {@link java.net.CookiePolicy#ACCEPT_NONE}. Implement
 * {@link java.net.CookiePolicy} to define a custom policy.
 *
 * <p>The default {@code CookieManager} keeps all accepted cookies in memory. It
 * will forget these cookies when the VM exits. Implement {@link java.net.CookieStore} to
 * define a custom cookie store.
 *
 * <p>In addition to the cookies set by HTTP responses, you may set cookies
 * programmatically. To be included in HTTP request headers, cookies must have
 * the domain and path properties set.
 *
 * <p>By default, new instances of {@code HttpCookie} work only with servers
 * that support <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt">RFC 2965</a>
 * cookies. Many web servers support only the older specification, <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt">RFC 2109</a>. For compatibility
 * with the most web servers, set the cookie version to 0.
 *
 * <p>For example, to receive {@code www.twitter.com} in French: <pre>   {@code
 *   HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("lang", "fr");
 *   cookie.setDomain("twitter.com");
 *   cookie.setPath("/");
 *   cookie.setVersion(0);
 *   cookieManager.getCookieStore().add(new URI("http://twitter.com/"), cookie);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
 * <p>{@code HttpURLConnection} uses the {@code GET} method by default. It will
 * use {@code POST} if {@link #setDoOutput setDoOutput(true)} has been called.
 * Other HTTP methods ({@code OPTIONS}, {@code HEAD}, {@code PUT}, {@code
 * DELETE} and {@code TRACE}) can be used with {@link #setRequestMethod}.
 *
 * <h3>Proxies</h3>
 * By default, this class will connect directly to the <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html">origin
 * server</a>. It can also connect via an {@link java.net.Proxy.Type#HTTP HTTP} or {@link
 * java.net.Proxy.Type#SOCKS SOCKS} proxy. To use a proxy, use {@link
 * java.net.URL#openConnection(java.net.Proxy) URL.openConnection(Proxy)} when creating the
 * connection.
 *
 * <h3>IPv6 Support</h3>
 * <p>This class includes transparent support for IPv6. For hosts with both IPv4
 * and IPv6 addresses, it will attempt to connect to each of a host's addresses
 * until a connection is established.
 *
 * <h3>Response Caching</h3>
 * Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) includes a response cache. See {@code
 * android.net.http.HttpResponseCache} for instructions on enabling HTTP caching
 * in your application.
 *
 * <h3>Avoiding Bugs In Earlier Releases</h3>
 * Prior to Android 2.2 (Froyo), this class had some frustrating bugs. In
 * particular, calling {@code close()} on a readable {@code InputStream} could
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2939">poison the
 * connection pool</a>. Work around this by disabling connection pooling:
 * <pre>   {@code
 * private void disableConnectionReuseIfNecessary() {
 *   // Work around pre-Froyo bugs in HTTP connection reuse.
 *   if (Integer.parseInt(Build.VERSION.SDK) < Build.VERSION_CODES.FROYO) {
 *     System.setProperty("http.keepAlive", "false");
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Each instance of {@code HttpURLConnection} may be used for one
 * request/response pair. Instances of this class are not thread safe.
