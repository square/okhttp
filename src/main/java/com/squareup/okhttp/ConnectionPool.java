/**
 * Manages reuse of HTTP and SPDY connections for reduced network latency. HTTP
 * requests that share the same {@link Address} may share a {@link Connection}.
 * This class implements the policy of which connections to keep open for future
 * use.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getDefault() system-wide default} uses system properties for
 * tuning parameters:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code http.keepAlive} true if HTTP and SPDY connections should be
 *       pooled at all. Default is true.
 *   <li>{@code http.maxConnections} maximum number of connections to each
 *       address. Default is 5.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The default instance <i>doesn't</i> adjust its configuration as system
 * properties are changed. This assumes that the applications that set these
 * parameters do so before making HTTP connections, and that this class is
 * initialized lazily.
