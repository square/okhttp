/**
 * An {@link java.net.HttpURLConnection} for HTTPS (<a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">RFC 2818</a>). A
 * connected {@code HttpsURLConnection} allows access to the
 * negotiated cipher suite, the server certificate chain, and the
 * client certificate chain if any.
 *
 * <h3>Providing an application specific X509TrustManager</h3>
 *
 * If an application wants to trust Certificate Authority (CA)
 * certificates that are not part of the system, it should specify its
 * own {@code X509TrustManager} via a {@code SSLSocketFactory} set on
 * the {@code HttpsURLConnection}. The {@code X509TrustManager} can be
 * created based on a {@code KeyStore} using a {@code
 * TrustManagerFactory} to supply trusted CA certificates. Note that
 * self-signed certificates are effectively their own CA and can be
 * trusted by including them in a {@code KeyStore}.
 *
 * <p>For example, to trust a set of certificates specified by a {@code KeyStore}:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   KeyStore keyStore = ...;
 *   TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance("X509");
 *   tmf.init(keyStore);
 *
 *   SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
 *   context.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);
 *
 *   URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/");
 *   HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
 *   urlConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(context.getSocketFactory());
 *   InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>It is possible to implement {@code X509TrustManager} directly
 * instead of using one created by a {@code
 * TrustManagerFactory}. While this is straightforward in the insecure
 * case of allowing all certificate chains to pass verification,
 * writing a proper implementation will usually want to take advantage
 * of {@link java.security.cert.CertPathValidator
 * CertPathValidator}. In general, it might be better to write a
 * custom {@code KeyStore} implementation to pass to the {@code
 * TrustManagerFactory} than to try and write a custom {@code
 * X509TrustManager}.
 *
 * <h3>Providing an application specific X509KeyManager</h3>
 *
 * A custom {@code X509KeyManager} can be used to supply a client
 * certificate and its associated private key to authenticate a
 * connection to the server. The {@code X509KeyManager} can be created
 * based on a {@code KeyStore} using a {@code KeyManagerFactory}.
 *
 * <p>For example, to supply client certificates from a {@code KeyStore}:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   KeyStore keyStore = ...;
 *   KeyManagerFactory kmf = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("X509");
 *   kmf.init(keyStore);
 *
 *   SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
 *   context.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(), null, null);
 *
 *   URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/");
 *   HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
 *   urlConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(context.getSocketFactory());
 *   InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>A {@code X509KeyManager} can also be implemented directly. This
 * can allow an application to return a certificate and private key
 * from a non-{@code KeyStore} source or to specify its own logic for
 * selecting a specific credential to use when many may be present in
 * a single {@code KeyStore}.
 *
 * <h3>TLS Intolerance Support</h3>
 *
 * This class attempts to create secure connections using common TLS
 * extensions and SSL deflate compression. Should that fail, the
 * connection will be retried with SSLv3 only.
