/**
 * Certificates to identify which peers to trust and also to earn the trust of those peers in kind.
 * Client and server exchange these certificates during the handshake phase of a TLS connection.
 *
 * ### Server Authentication
 *
 * This is the most common form of TLS authentication: clients verify that servers are trusted and
 * that they own the hostnames that they represent. Server authentication is required.
 *
 * To perform server authentication:
 *
 *  * The server's handshake certificates must have a [held certificate][HeldCertificate] (a
 *    certificate and its private key). The certificate's subject alternative names must match the
 *    server's hostname. The server must also have is a (possibly-empty) chain of intermediate
 *    certificates to establish trust from a root certificate to the server's certificate. The root
 *    certificate is not included in this chain.
 *  * The client's handshake certificates must include a set of trusted root certificates. They will
 *    be used to authenticate the server's certificate chain. Typically this is a set of well-known
 *    root certificates that is distributed with the HTTP client or its platform. It may be
 *    augmented by certificates private to an organization or service.
 *
 * ### Client Authentication
 *
 * This is authentication of the client by the server during the TLS handshake. Client
 * authentication is optional.
 *
 * To perform client authentication:
 *
 *  * The client's handshake certificates must have a [held certificate][HeldCertificate] (a
 *    certificate and its private key). The client must also have a (possibly-empty) chain of
 *    intermediate certificates to establish trust from a root certificate to the client's
 *    certificate. The root certificate is not included in this chain.
 *  * The server's handshake certificates must include a set of trusted root certificates. They
 *    will be used to authenticate the client's certificate chain. Typically this is not the same
 *    set of root certificates used in server authentication. Instead it will be a small set of
 *    roots private to an organization or service.
